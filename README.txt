Author z5050181 Tianxing Hu.
The structure would be like:
	- a3search.cpp
	- makefile
	- stmr.cpp
	- stmr.h
	- stopwords.cpp	
	- Synonyms.dictionary

	2nd.  build a word index file
	      1.dealing with Caps,non-words&stem,moreover delete stop words.
		which stem word by using stmr.
	      2.use map<word,map<fileID,frequncy> as word index.

2.Searching
