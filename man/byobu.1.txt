       Options to bbyyoobbuu are simply passed through ssccrreeeenn(1) or ttmmuuxx(1).


DDEESSCCRRIIPPTTIIOONN
       bbyyoobbuu is a script that launches a text  based  window  manager  (either
       ssccrreeeenn(1)  or  ttmmuuxx(1))  in  the byobu configuration.  This enables the
       display of system information and status notifications within two lines
       at  the  bottom  of the screen session. It also enables multiple tabbed
       terminal sessions, accessible through simple keystrokes.

       bbyyoobbuu currently defaults to using ttmmuuxx(1) (if present) as the  backend,
       however,  this can be overridden with the bbyyoobbuu--sseelleecctt--bbaacckkeenndd(1) util-
       ity.

       Note  that  BYOBU_CONFIG_DIR=_$_X_D_G___C_O_N_F_I_G___H_O_M_E_/_b_y_o_b_u  if  defined,   and
       _$_H_O_M_E_/_._b_y_o_b_u otherwise.

       The  background  colors  of  the  bbyyoobbuu status lines can be adjusted by
       editing   the   files   _$_H_O_M_E_/_._b_y_o_b_u_/_c_o_l_o_r   (for   bbyyoobbuu--ssccrreeeenn)   and

       will change the background to a randomly selected color when running in
       bbyyoobbuu--ttmmuuxx  mode.   Simply  remove those files to return to the default
       color configuration.

       bbyyoobbuu supports a number of unique and interesting status  notifications
       across  the  lowest  two lines in the screen.  Each status notification
       item is independently configurable, enabled and disabled by the config-
       uration  utility.   The guide below helps identify each status item (in
       alphabetical order):

       aappppoorrtt - symbol displayed if there are pending crash reports; {!}  sym-
       bol  displayed  on the lower bar toward the left, in black on an orange
       background

       aarrcchh - system architecture; displayed on the lower bar toward the left,
       in the default text color on the default background color

       bbaatttteerryy  -  battery  information;  display  on the lower bar toward the
       right; - indicates discharging, + indicates charging, = indicates fully
       charged;  when charging or discharging, the current battery capacity as
       a percentage is displayed;  the colours green, yellow, and red are used
       to give further indication of the battery's charge state; you may over-
       ride the detected battery by setting BATTERY=/proc/acpi/battery/BAT0 in
       _$_B_Y_O_B_U___C_O_N_F_I_G___D_I_R_/_s_t_a_t_u_s_r_c

       lower bar toward the right in white text on a light blue background

       ccppuu__tteemmpp - the cpu temperature in Celsius (default) or Fahrenheit, con-
       figure TEMP=F or TEMP=C in _$_B_Y_O_B_U___C_O_N_F_I_G___D_I_R_/_s_t_a_t_u_s_r_c; displayed in the
       lower bar toward the right in yellow text on a  black  background;  you
       may  override  the  detected  cpu  temperature  device by setting MONI-
       TORED_TEMP=/proc/acpi/whatever in _$_B_Y_O_B_U___C_O_N_F_I_G___D_I_R_/_s_t_a_t_u_s_r_c

       ccuussttoomm - user defined custom scripts; must be  executable  programs  of
       any kind in _$_B_Y_O_B_U___C_O_N_F_I_G___D_I_R_/_b_i_n; must be named N_NAME, where N is the
       frequency in seconds to refresh the status indicator, and NAME  is  the
       name  of  the  script;  N should not be less than 5 seconds; the script
       should echo a small amount of text to standard out, standard  error  is
       discarded;  the  indicator  will  be  displayed  in the lower panel, in
       default colors, unless you manually specify the colors in your script's
       output;  BEWARE,  cpu-intensive  custom scripts may impact your overall
       system performance and could upset your system administrator!  In fact,
       you  can  easily  copy  and  modify  aannyy status script usually found in
       _/_u_s_r_/_l_i_b_/_b_y_o_b_u_/_* to your local _$_H_O_M_E_/_._b_y_o_b_u_/ directory.

       _F_I_G___D_I_R_/_w_i_n_d_o_w_s.  This file is the same  syntax  as  _~_/_._s_c_r_e_e_n_r_c,  each
       line  specifying  a  window using the "screen" command, as described in
       ssccrreeeenn(1).

       User can also launch Byobu with unique window sets.   Users  can  store
       these  as  _$_B_Y_O_B_U___C_O_N_F_I_G___D_I_R_/_w_i_n_d_o_w_s_._[_N_A_M_E_],  and launch Byobu with the
       environment variable BBYYOOBBUU__WWIINNDDOOWWSS.

       For example:
         $ cat $BYOBU_CONFIG_DIR/windows.ssh_sessions
         screen -t localhost bash
         screen -t aussie ssh root@aussie
         screen -t beagle ssh root@beagle
         screen -t collie ssh root@collie
         $ BYOBU_WINDOWS=ssh_sessions byobu

       byobu uses binary for capacity measurements of  KB,  MB,  GB,  and  TB.
       This  means  multiples of 1024 rather than multiples of 1000, in accor-
       dance with JEDEC Standard 100B.01 for disk and memory capacity measure-
       ments.  See:
        * http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JEDEC_memory_standards

       byobu  uses  decimal for measurements of network data transfer, meaning
       multiple of 1000, rather than 1024.  See:

       byobu keybindings can be user defined in  /usr/share/byobu/keybindings/
       (or within .screenrc if byobu-export was used). The common key bindings
       are:

       FF22 - Create a new window

       FF33 - Move to previous window

       FF44 - Move to next window

       FF55 - Reload profile

       FF66 - Detach from this session

       FF77 - Enter copy/scrollback mode

       FF88 - Re-title a window

       FF99 - Configuration Menu

       FF1122 -  Lock this terminal

       sshhiifftt--FF22 - Split the screen horizontally

       ccttrrll--FF22 - Split the screen vertically

       sshhiifftt--FF33 - Shift the focus to the previous split region

       sshhiifftt--FF44 - Shift the focus to the next split region

       sshhiifftt--FF55 - Join all splits

       ccttrrll--FF66 - Remove this split

       ccttrrll--FF55 - Reconnect GPG and SSH sockets

       sshhiifftt--FF66 - Detach, but do not logout

       aalltt--ppgguupp - Enter scrollback mode

       aalltt--ppggddnn - Enter scrollback mode

       CCttrrll--aa $$ - show detailed status

       CCttrrll--aa RR - Reload profile

       CCttrrll--aa !! - Toggle key bindings on and off

       CCttrrll--aa kk - Kill the current window

       CCttrrll--aa ~~ - Save the current window's scrollback buffer

       Each window in Byobu has up to  10,000  lines  of  scrollback  history,
       which  you can enter and navigate using the aalltt--ppgguupp and aalltt--ppggddnn keys.
       Exit this scrollback mode by hitting eenntteerr.  You can also  easily  copy
       and  paste text from scrollback mode.  To do so, enter scrollback using
       aalltt--ppgguupp or aalltt--ppggddnn, press the ssppaacceebbaarr to  start  highlighting  text,
       use uupp//ddoowwnn//lleefftt//rriigghhtt//ppgguupp//ppggddnn to select the text, and press eenntteerr to
       copy the text.  You can then paste the text using aalltt--iinnsseerrtt  or  ccttrrll--

BBUUGGSS
       For Byobu colors to work properly, older versions of GNU Screen require
       a 1-line patch to adjust MAX_WINMSG_REND in screen.c.  The change is in
       GNU  Screen's  upstream source control system as of 2010-01-26, but GNU
       Screen has not released a new upstream version in several  years.   You
       can  disable  colors  entirely  by  setting MONOCHROME=1 in _$_B_Y_O_B_U___C_O_N_-
       _F_I_G___D_I_R_/_s_t_a_t_u_s_r_c.  For more information, see:
        * http://savannah.gnu.org/bugs/?22146

       PuTTY users have reported that the F2, F3, and F4 shortcut keys are not
       working  properly.   PuTTY sends the same escape sequences as the linux
       console for F1-F4 by default.  You can fix this problem  in  the  PuTTY
       config,  Terminal  ->  Keyboard  ->  Function  keys:  Xterm  R6.   See:
       _h_t_t_p_:_/_/_w_w_w_._m_a_i_l_-_a_r_c_h_i_v_e_._c_o_m_/_s_c_r_e_e_n_-_u_s_e_r_s_@_g_n_u_._o_r_g_/_m_s_g_0_1_5_2_5_._h_t_m_l

       PuTTY users should configure enable UTF-8 characters in  order  to  fix
       status  refresh issues.  You can fix this problem in the PuTTY configu-
       ration, Window -> Translation: select UTF-8.

       PuTTY users should avoid resizing their window to one  character  tall,
       as this can sometimes crash bbyyoobbuu--ssccrreeeenn.

       Apple  Mac  OSX  terminal users have reported 'flashing text'.  You can
       fix this in the advanced settings of  the  terminal  application,  with
       'Declare Terminal As: xterm-color'.

       Apple Mac keyboard users may need to specify a vt100 terminal by adding
       this to your OSX profile, in order to get  Byobu's  function  keys  and
       colors to work:
         alias ssh='TERM=vt100 ssh'

       Users  of  a  non-UTF-8  locale (such as cs_CZ charset ISO-8859-2), may
       need to add "defutf8 off" to _~_/_._s_c_r_e_e_n_r_c, if some characters  are  ren-
       dering as "?".

       Users  who  customize  their  PS1  prompt  need  to put this setting in
       _~_/_._b_a_s_h_r_c, rather than _~_/_._p_r_o_f_i_l_e, in order for it  to  work  correctly
       with Byobu.

       If  you  run  bbyyoobbuu(1)  under ssuuddoo(8), you mmuusstt use the -H option, such
       that the user's $HOME directory environment variable is  set  properly.
       Otherwise,   bbyyoobbuu(1)  will  create  a  bunch  of  directories  in  the
       $SUDO_USER's $HOME, but will be owned by root.  To  prevent  this  from
       happening,  bbyyoobbuu(1)  will  simply  refuse to run if $USER does not own
       $HOME.

       Byobu requires a suitable uulliimmiitt(3) values to run.  If you get an error
       at  startup saying, 'pipe: too many open files', then check your ulimit
       -a values, as your "open files" or "max user processes"  are  too  low.
       In this case, you will probably need to run simple ssccrreeeenn(1)
