       sseettuuppccoonn  is a program for fast and easy setup of the font and the key-
       board on the Linux console.

OOPPTTIIOONNSS
       -k, --keyboard-only
              Setup the keyboard only, do not setup the font.

       -f, --font-only
              Setup the font only, do not setup the keyboard.

       --force
              Do not check whether we are on the console.  Notice that you can
              be  forced to hard-reboot your computer if you run setupcon with
              this option and you are on a X server.

       -v, --verbose
              Be more verbose.   Use this option if something goes wrong.

       --save If you want to use setupcon early in the  boot  process,  it  is
              possible  that /usr is not yet mounted and the required data are
              not available.  This option makes  setupcon  copy  the  required
              data  in /etc/console-setup in order to make it available before
              /usr is mounted.  If you use setupcon early in the boot process,
              then  use this option whenever you change the console configura-
              tion.

       --save-only
              Same like --save, but do not setup the keyboard  and  the  font.
              This option can be useful if you run setupcon in a X server.

       -h, --help
              Display usage information.

       variant
              Specifies  which configuration file to use.  By default the con-
              figuration file of setupcon is /etc/default/console-setup but if
              you  use  e.g.  "chukchi" as variant then the configuration file
              will be /etc/default/console-setup.chukchi.  This allows you  to
              have  several different configurations - for example one for the
              Chukchi language and another in  /etc/default/console-setup  for
              your default configuration.

       Most of the time you invoke setupcon without arguments.  Please look at
       the README file for more information.
