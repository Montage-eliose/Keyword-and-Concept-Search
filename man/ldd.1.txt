       ldd - print shared library dependencies

       lldddd  prints  the  shared  libraries  required by each program or shared
       library specified on the command line.

   SSeeccuurriittyy
       In the usual  case,  lldddd  invokes  the  standard  dynamic  linker  (see
       lldd..ssoo(8))  with the LLDD__TTRRAACCEE__LLOOAADDEEDD__OOBBJJEECCTTSS environment variable set to
       1, which causes the linker to display  the  library  dependencies.   Be
       aware,  however,  that  in some circumstances, some versions of lldddd may
       attempt to obtain the dependency information by directly executing  the
       program.  Thus, you should _n_e_v_e_r employ lldddd on an untrusted executable,
       since this may result in the execution  of  arbitrary  code.   A  safer
       alternative when dealing with untrusted executables is:

           $ objdump -p /path/to/program | grep NEEDED

OOPPTTIIOONNSS
       ----vveerrssiioonn
              Print the version number of lldddd.

       --vv ----vveerrbboossee
              Print all information, including, for example, symbol versioning
              information.

       --uu ----uunnuusseedd
              Print unused direct dependencies.  (Since glibc 2.3.4.)

       --dd ----ddaattaa--rreellooccss
              Perform relocations and report any missing objects (ELF only).

       --rr ----ffuunnccttiioonn--rreellooccss
              Perform relocations for both data  objects  and  functions,  and
              report any missing objects or functions (ELF only).

       ----hheellpp Usage information.

NNOOTTEESS
       The  standard  version  of  lldddd  comes with glibc2.  Libc5 came with an
       older version, still present on some systems.  The long options are not
       supported  by the libc5 version.  On the other hand, the glibc2 version
       does not support --VV and only has the equivalent ----vveerrssiioonn.

       The libc5 version of this program will use the name of a library  given
       on the command line as-is when it contains a '/'; otherwise it searches
       for the library in the standard locations.   To  run  it  on  a  shared
       library in the current directory, prefix the name with "./".

BBUUGGSS
       lldddd does not work on a.out shared libraries.

       lldddd  does  not  work  with some extremely old a.out programs which were
       built before lldddd support was added to the compiler  releases.   If  you
       use  lldddd on one of these programs, the program will attempt to run with
       _a_r_g_c = 0 and the results will be unpredictable.
