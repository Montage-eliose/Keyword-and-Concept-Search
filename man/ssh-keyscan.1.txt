     sssshh--kkeeyyssccaann is a utility for gathering the public ssh host keys of a num-
     ber of hosts.  It was designed to aid in building and verifying
     _s_s_h___k_n_o_w_n___h_o_s_t_s files.  sssshh--kkeeyyssccaann provides a minimal interface suitable
     for use by shell and perl scripts.

     sssshh--kkeeyyssccaann uses non-blocking socket I/O to contact as many hosts as pos-
     sible in parallel, so it is very efficient.  The keys from a domain of
     1,000 hosts can be collected in tens of seconds, even when some of those
     hosts are down or do not run ssh.  For scanning, one does not need login
     access to the machines that are being scanned, nor does the scanning
     process involve any encryption.

     The options are as follows:

     --44      Forces sssshh--kkeeyyssccaann to use IPv4 addresses only.

     --66      Forces sssshh--kkeeyyssccaann to use IPv6 addresses only.

     --ff _f_i_l_e
             Read hosts or ``addrlist namelist'' pairs from _f_i_l_e, one per
             line.  If _- is supplied instead of a filename, sssshh--kkeeyyssccaann will
             read hosts or ``addrlist namelist'' pairs from the standard
             input.

     --HH      Hash all hostnames and addresses in the output.  Hashed names may
             be used normally by sssshh and sssshhdd, but they do not reveal identi-
             fying information should the file's contents be disclosed.

     --pp _p_o_r_t
             Port to connect to on the remote host.

     --TT _t_i_m_e_o_u_t
             Set the timeout for connection attempts.  If _t_i_m_e_o_u_t seconds have
             elapsed since a connection was initiated to a host or since the
             last time anything was read from that host, then the connection
             is closed and the host in question considered unavailable.
             Default is 5 seconds.

     --tt _t_y_p_e
             Specifies the type of the key to fetch from the scanned hosts.
             The possible values are ``rsa1'' for protocol version 1 and
             ``dsa'', ``ecdsa'', ``ed25519'', or ``rsa'' for protocol version
             2.  Multiple values may be specified by separating them with com-
             mas.  The default is to fetch ``rsa'' and ``ecdsa'' keys.

     --vv      Verbose mode.  Causes sssshh--kkeeyyssccaann to print debugging messages
             about its progress.

SSEECCUURRIITTYY
     If an ssh_known_hosts file is constructed using sssshh--kkeeyyssccaann without veri-
     fying the keys, users will be vulnerable to _m_a_n _i_n _t_h_e _m_i_d_d_l_e attacks.
     On the other hand, if the security model allows such a risk, sssshh--kkeeyyssccaann
     can help in the detection of tampered keyfiles or man in the middle
     attacks which have begun after the ssh_known_hosts file was created.

     It generates "Connection closed by remote host" messages on the consoles
     of all the machines it scans if the server is older than version 2.9.
     This is because it opens a connection to the ssh port, reads the public
     key, and drops the connection as soon as it gets the key.
