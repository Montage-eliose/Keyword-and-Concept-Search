       c_rehash scans directories and takes a hash value of each .pem and .crt
       file in the directory. It then creates symbolic links for each of the
       files named by the hash value. This is useful as many programs require
       directories to be set up like this in order to find the certificates
       they require.

       If any directories are named on the command line then these directories
       are processed in turn. If not then and the environment variable
       SSL_CERT_DIR is defined then that is consulted. This variable should be
       a colon (:) separated list of directories, all of which will be
       processed. If neither of these conditions are true then
       /usr/lib/ssl/certs is processed.

       For each directory that is to be processed he user must have write
       permissions on the directory, if they do not then nothing will be
       printed for that directory.

       Note that this program deletes all the symbolic links that look like
       ones that it creates before processing a directory. Beware that if you
       run the program on a directory that contains symbolic links for other
       purposes that are named in the same format as those created by this
       program they will be lost.

       The hashes for certificate files are of the form <hash>.<n> where n is
       an integer. If the hash value already exists then n will be
       incremented, unless the file is a duplicate. Duplicates are detected
       using the fingerprint of the certificate. A warning will be printed if
       a duplicate is detected. The hashes for CRL files are of the form
       <hash>.r<n> and have the same behavior.

       The program will also warn if there are files with extension .pem which
       are not certificate or CRL files.

       The program uses the openssl program to compute the hashes and
       fingerprints. It expects the executable to be named openssl and be on
       the PATH, or in the /usr/lib/ssl/bin directory. If the OPENSSL
       environment variable is defined then this is used instead as the
       executable that provides the hashes and fingerprints. When called as
       $OPENSSL x509 -hash -fingerprint -noout -in $file it must output the
       hash of $file on the first line followed by the fingerprint on the
       second line, optionally prefixed with some text and an equals sign (=).
