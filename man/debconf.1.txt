       Debconf is a configuration system for Debian packages. For a debconf
       overview and documentation for sysadmins, see _d_e_b_c_o_n_f(7) (in the
       debconf-doc package).

       The ddeebbccoonnff program runs a program under debconf's control, setting it
       up to talk with debconf on stdio. The program's output is expected to
       be debconf protocol commands, and it is expected to read result codes
       on stdin. See _d_e_b_c_o_n_f_-_d_e_v_e_l(7) for details about the debconf protocol.

       The command to be run under debconf must be specified in a way that
       will let your PATH find it.

       This command is not the usual way that debconf is used. It's more
       typical for debconf to be used via _d_p_k_g_-_p_r_e_c_o_n_f_i_g_u_r_e(8) or
       _d_p_k_g_-_r_e_c_o_n_f_i_g_u_r_e(8).

           Tell debconf what package the command it is running is a part of.
           This is necessary to get ownership of registered questions right,
           and to support unregister and purge commands properly.

           Select the frontend to use.

           Specify the minimum priority of question that will be displayed.

       ----tteerrssee
           Enables terse output mode. This affects only some frontends.

       To debug a shell script that uses debconf, you might use:

        DEBCONF_DEBUG=developer debconf my-shell-prog

       Or, you might use this:

        debconf --frontend=readline sh -x my-shell-prog
