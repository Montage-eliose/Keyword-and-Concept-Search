       The rreeppllaaccee utility program changes strings in place in files or on the
       standard input.

       Invoke rreeppllaaccee in one of the following ways:

           shell> rreeppllaaccee _f_r_o_m _t_o [[_f_r_o_m _t_o]] ...... ---- _f_i_l_e___n_a_m_e [[_f_i_l_e___n_a_m_e]] ......
           shell> rreeppllaaccee _f_r_o_m _t_o [[_f_r_o_m _t_o]] ...... << _f_i_l_e___n_a_m_e

       _f_r_o_m represents a string to look for and _t_o represents its replacement.
       There can be one or more pairs of strings.

       Use the ---- option to indicate where the string-replacement list ends
       and the file names begin. In this case, any file named on the command
       line is modified in place, so you may want to make a copy of the
       original before converting it.  _r_e_p_l_a_c_e prints a message indicating
       which of the input files it actually modifies.

       If the ---- option is not given, rreeppllaaccee reads the standard input and
       writes to the standard output.

       rreeppllaaccee uses a finite state machine to match longer strings first. It
       can be used to swap strings. For example, the following command swaps a
       and b in the given files, file1 and file2:

           shell> rreeppllaaccee aa bb bb aa ---- ffiillee11 ffiillee22 ......

       The rreeppllaaccee program is used by mmssqqll22mmyyssqqll. See mmssqqll22mmyyssqqll(1).

       rreeppllaaccee supports the following options.

       +o   --??, --II

           Display a help message and exit.

       +o   --##_d_e_b_u_g___o_p_t_i_o_n_s

           Enable debugging.

       +o   --ss

           Silent mode. Print less information what the program does.

       +o   --vv

           Verbose mode. Print more information about what the program does.

       +o   --VV

           Display version information and exit.
