DDEESSCCRRIIPPTTIIOONN
       The ssuu command is used to become another user during a login session.
       Invoked without a uusseerrnnaammee, ssuu defaults to becoming the superuser. The
       optional argument -- may be used to provide an environment similar to
       what the user would expect had the user logged in directly.

       Additional arguments may be provided after the username, in which case
       they are supplied to the user's login shell. In particular, an argument
       of --cc will cause the next argument to be treated as a command by most
       command interpreters. The command will be executed by the shell
       specified in /etc/passwd for the target user.

       You can use the ---- argument to separate ssuu options from the arguments
       supplied to the shell.

       The user will be prompted for a password, if appropriate. Invalid
       passwords will produce an error message. All attempts, both valid and
       invalid, are logged to detect abuse of the system.

       The current environment is passed to the new shell. The value of $$PPAATTHH
       is reset to /bin:/usr/bin for normal users, or
       /sbin:/bin:/usr/sbin:/usr/bin for the superuser. This may be changed
       with the EENNVV__PPAATTHH and EENNVV__SSUUPPAATTHH definitions in /etc/login.defs.

       A subsystem login is indicated by the presence of a "*" as the first
       character of the login shell. The given home directory will be used as
       the root of a new file system which the user is actually logged into.

OOPPTTIIOONNSS
       The options which apply to the ssuu command are:

       --cc, ----ccoommmmaanndd _C_O_M_M_A_N_D
           Specify a command that will be invoked by the shell using its --cc.

           The executed command will have no controlling terminal. This option
           cannot be used to execute interractive programs which need a
           controlling TTY.

       --, --ll, ----llooggiinn
           Provide an environment similar to what the user would expect had
           the user logged in directly.

           When -- is used, it must be specified as the last ssuu option. The
           other forms (--ll and ----llooggiinn) do not have this restriction.

       --ss, ----sshheellll _S_H_E_L_L
           The shell that will be invoked.

           The invoked shell is chosen from (highest priority first):

               The shell specified with --shell.

               If ----pprreesseerrvvee--eennvviirroonnmmeenntt is used, the shell specified by the
               $$SSHHEELLLL environment variable.

               The shell indicated in the /etc/passwd entry for the target
               user.

               /bin/sh if a shell could not be found by any above method.

           If the target user has a restricted shell (i.e. the shell field of
           this user's entry in /etc/passwd is not listed in /etc/shells),
           then the ----sshheellll option or the $$SSHHEELLLL environment variable won't be
           taken into account, unless ssuu is called by root.

       --mm, --pp, ----pprreesseerrvvee--eennvviirroonnmmeenntt
           Preserve the current environment, except for:

           $$PPAATTHH
               reset according to the /etc/login.defs options EENNVV__PPAATTHH or
               EENNVV__SSUUPPAATTHH (see below);

           $$IIFFSS
               reset to "<space><tab><newline>", if it was set.

           If the target user has a restricted shell, this option has no
           effect (unless ssuu is called by root).

           Note that the default behavior for the environment is the
           following:

               The $$HHOOMMEE, $$SSHHEELLLL, $$UUSSEERR, $$LLOOGGNNAAMMEE, $$PPAATTHH, and $$IIFFSS environment
               variables are reset.

               If ----llooggiinn is not used, the environment is copied, except for
               the variables above.

               If ----llooggiinn is used, the $$TTEERRMM, $$CCOOLLOORRTTEERRMM, $$DDIISSPPLLAAYY, and
               $$XXAAUUTTHHOORRIITTYY environment variables are copied if they were set.

               Other environments might be set by PAM modules.


CCAAVVEEAATTSS
       This version of ssuu has many compilation options, only some of which may
       be in use at any particular site.

CCOONNFFIIGGUURRAATTIIOONN
       The following configuration variables in /etc/login.defs change the
       behavior of this tool:

       CCOONNSSOOLLEE__GGRROOUUPPSS (string)
           List of groups to add to the user's supplementary groups set when
           logging in on the console (as determined by the CONSOLE setting).
           Default is none.

           Use with caution - it is possible for users to gain permanent
           access to these groups, even when not logged in on the console.

       DDEEFFAAUULLTT__HHOOMMEE (boolean)
           Indicate if login is allowed if we can't cd to the home directory.
           Default is no.

           If set to _y_e_s, the user will login in the root (/) directory if it
           is not possible to cd to her home directory.

       EENNVV__PPAATTHH (string)
           If set, it will be used to define the PATH environment variable
           when a regular user login. The value is a colon separated list of
           paths (for example _/_b_i_n_:_/_u_s_r_/_b_i_n) and can be preceded by _P_A_T_H_=. The
           default value is _P_A_T_H_=_/_b_i_n_:_/_u_s_r_/_b_i_n.

       EENNVV__SSUUPPAATTHH (string)
           If set, it will be used to define the PATH environment variable
           when the superuser login. The value is a colon separated list of
           paths (for example _/_s_b_i_n_:_/_b_i_n_:_/_u_s_r_/_s_b_i_n_:_/_u_s_r_/_b_i_n) and can be
           preceded by _P_A_T_H_=. The default value is
           _P_A_T_H_=_/_s_b_i_n_:_/_b_i_n_:_/_u_s_r_/_s_b_i_n_:_/_u_s_r_/_b_i_n.

       SSUULLOOGG__FFIILLEE (string)
           If defined, all su activity is logged to this file.

       SSUU__NNAAMMEE (string)
           If defined, the command name to display when running "su -". For
           example, if this is defined as "su" then a "ps" will display the
           command is "-su". If not defined, then "ps" would display the name
           of the shell actually being run, e.g. something like "-sh".

       SSYYSSLLOOGG__SSUU__EENNAABB (boolean)
           Enable "syslog" logging of ssuu activity - in addition to sulog file
           logging.

FFIILLEESS
       /etc/passwd
           User account information.

       /etc/shadow
           Secure user account information.

       /etc/login.defs
           Shadow password suite configuration.

EEXXIITT VVAALLUUEESS
       On success, ssuu returns the exit value of the command it executed.

       If this command was terminated by a signal, ssuu returns the number of
       this signal plus 128.

       If su has to kill the command (because it was asked to terminate, and
       the command did not terminate in time), ssuu returns 255.

       Some exit values from ssuu are independent from the executed command:

       _0
           success (----hheellpp only)

       _1
           System or authentication failure

       _1_2_6
           The requested command was not found

       _1_2_7
           The requested command could not be executed

SSEEEE AALLSSOO
       llooggiinn(1), llooggiinn..ddeeffss(5), ssgg(1), sshh(1).
