       Initially, the MySQL C API was developed to be very similar to that for
       the mSQL database system. Because of this, mSQL programs often can be
       converted relatively easily for use with MySQL by changing the names of
       the C API functions.

       The mmssqqll22mmyyssqqll utility performs the conversion of mSQL C API function
       calls to their MySQL equivalents.  mmssqqll22mmyyssqqll converts the input file
       in place, so make a copy of the original before converting it. For
       example, use mmssqqll22mmyyssqqll like this:

           shell> ccpp cclliieenntt--pprroogg..cc cclliieenntt--pprroogg..cc..oorriigg
           shell> mmssqqll22mmyyssqqll cclliieenntt--pprroogg..cc
           client-prog.c converted

       Then examine client-prog.c and make any post-conversion revisions that
       may be necessary.

       mmssqqll22mmyyssqqll uses the rreeppllaaccee utility to make the function name
       substitutions. See rreeppllaaccee(1).
