     mmoorree is a filter for paging through text one screenful at a time.  This
     version is especially primitive.  Users should realize that less(1) pro-
     vides more(1) emulation plus extensive enhancements.

     Command-line options are described below.  Options are also taken from
     the environment variable MORE (make sure to precede them with a dash
     (``-'')) but command line options will override them.

     --nnuumm  This option specifies an integer which is the screen size (in
           lines).

     --dd    mmoorree will prompt the user with the message "[Press space to con-
           tinue, 'q' to quit.]" and will display "[Press 'h' for instruc-
           tions.]" instead of ringing the bell when an illegal key is
           pressed.

     --ll    mmoorree usually treats ^^LL (form feed) as a special character, and will
           pause after any line that contains a form feed.  The --ll option will
           prevent this behavior.

     --ff    Causes mmoorree to count logical, rather than screen lines (i.e., long
           lines are not folded).

     --pp    Do not scroll.  Instead, clear the whole screen and then display
           the text.

           Notice that this option is switched on automatically if the exe-
           cutable is named ppaaggee.

     --cc    Do not scroll.  Instead, paint each screen from the top, clearing
           the remainder of each line as it is displayed.

     --ss    Squeeze multiple blank lines into one.

     --uu    Suppress underlining.

     ++//    The ++// option specifies a string that will be searched for before
           each file is displayed.

     ++nnuumm  Start at line number nnuumm.

     Interactive commands for mmoorree are based on vi(1).  Some commands may be
     preceded by a decimal number, called k in the descriptions below.  In the
     following descriptions, ^X means control-X.

     hh or ?      Help: display a summary of these commands.  If you forget all
                 the other commands, remember this one.

     SSPPAACCEE       Display next k lines of text.  Defaults to current screen
                 size.

     zz           Display next k lines of text.  Defaults to current screen
                 size.  Argument becomes new default.

     RREETTUURRNN      Display next k lines of text.  Defaults to 1.  Argument
                 becomes new default.

     dd or ^^DD     Scroll k lines.  Default is current scroll size, initially
                 11.  Argument becomes new default.

     qq or QQ or IINNTTEERRRRUUPPTT
                 Exit.

     ss           Skip forward k lines of text.  Defaults to 1.

     ff           Skip forward k screenfuls of text.  Defaults to 1.

     bb or ^^BB     Skip backwards k screenfuls of text.  Defaults to 1.  Only
                 works with files, not pipes.

     ''           Go to place where previous search started.

     ==           Display current line number.

     //_p_a_t_t_e_r_n    Search for kth occurrence of regular expression.  Defaults to
                 1.

     nn           Search for kth occurrence of last r.e.  Defaults to 1.

     !!<<ccmmdd>> or ::!!<<ccmmdd>>
                 Execute <cmd> in a subshell

     vv           Start up an editor at current line.  The editor is taken from
                 the environment variable VISUAL if defined, or EDITOR if VIS-
                 UAL is not defined, or defaults to "vi" if neither VISUAL nor
                 EDITOR is defined.

     ^^LL          Redraw screen

     ::nn          Go to kth next file.  Defaults to 1.

     ::pp          Go to kth previous file.  Defaults to 1.

     ::ff          Display current file name and line number

     ..           Repeat previous command

     MMoorree utilizes the following environment variables, if they exist:

     MORE        This variable may be set with favored options to mmoorree.

     SHELL       Current shell in use (normally set by the shell at login
                 time).

     TERM        Specifies terminal type, used by more to get the terminal
                 characteristics necessary to manipulate the screen.

     The mmoorree command appeared in 3.0BSD.  This man page documents mmoorree ver-
     sion 5.19 (Berkeley 6/29/88), which is currently in use in the Linux com-
     munity.  Documentation was produced using several other versions of the
     man page, and extensive inspection of the source code.
