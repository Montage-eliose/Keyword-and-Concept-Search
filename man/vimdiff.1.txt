NNAAMMEE
       vimdiff  - edit two, three or four versions of a file with Vim and show
       differences

DDEESSCCRRIIPPTTIIOONN
       VViimmddiiffff starts VViimm on two (or three or four) files.  Each file gets its
       own  window.   The differences between the files are highlighted.  This
       is a nice way to inspect changes and to move changes from  one  version
       to another version of the same file.

       See vim(1) for details about Vim itself.

       When started as ggvviimmddiiffff the GUI will be started, if available.

       In  each window the 'diff' option will be set, which causes the differ-
       ences to be highlighted.
       The 'wrap' and 'scrollbind' options are set to make the text look good.
       The 'foldmethod' option is set to "diff", which puts  ranges  of  lines
       without  changes in a fold.  'foldcolumn' is set to two to make it easy
       to spot the folds and open or close them.

OOPPTTIIOONNSS
       Vertical splits are used to align the lines, as if  the  "-O"  argument
       was used.  To use horizontal splits instead, use the "-o" argument.

       For all other arguments see vim(1).
