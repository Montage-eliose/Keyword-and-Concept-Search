DDEESSCCRRIIPPTTIIOONN
       ppoodd22mmaann is a front-end for Pod::Man, using it to generate *roff input
       from POD source.  The resulting *roff code is suitable for display on a
       terminal using _n_r_o_f_f(1), normally via _m_a_n(1), or printing using
       _t_r_o_f_f(1).

       _i_n_p_u_t is the file to read for POD source (the POD can be embedded in
       code).  If _i_n_p_u_t isn't given, it defaults to "STDIN".  _o_u_t_p_u_t, if
       given, is the file to which to write the formatted output.  If _o_u_t_p_u_t
       isn't given, the formatted output is written to "STDOUT".  Several POD
       files can be processed in the same ppoodd22mmaann invocation (saving module
       load and compile times) by providing multiple pairs of _i_n_p_u_t and _o_u_t_p_u_t
       files on the command line.

       ----sseeccttiioonn, ----rreelleeaassee, ----cceenntteerr, ----ddaattee, and ----ooffffiicciiaall can be used to
       set the headers and footers to use; if not given, Pod::Man will assume
       various defaults.  See below or Pod::Man for details.

       ppoodd22mmaann assumes that your *roff formatters have a fixed-width font
       named "CW".  If yours is called something else (like "CR"), use ----ffiixxeedd
       to specify it.  This generally only matters for troff output for
       printing.  Similarly, you can set the fonts used for bold, italic, and
       bold italic fixed-width output.

       Besides the obvious pod conversions, Pod::Man, and therefore pod2man
       also takes care of formatting _f_u_n_c_(_), func(n), and simple variable
       references like $foo or @bar so you don't have to use code escapes for
       them; complex expressions like $fred{'stuff'} will still need to be
       escaped, though.  It also translates dashes that aren't used as hyphens
       into en dashes, makes long dashes--like this--into proper em dashes,
       fixes "paired quotes," and takes care of several other troff-specific
       tweaks.  See Pod::Man for complete information.

OOPPTTIIOONNSS
       --cc _s_t_r_i_n_g, ----cceenntteerr=_s_t_r_i_n_g
           Sets the centered page header to _s_t_r_i_n_g.  The default is "User
           Contributed Perl Documentation", but also see ----ooffffiicciiaall below.

       --dd _s_t_r_i_n_g, ----ddaattee=_s_t_r_i_n_g
           Set the left-hand footer string to this value.  By default, the
           modification date of the input file will be used, or the current
           date if input comes from "STDIN".

       --eerrrroorrss=_s_t_y_l_e
           Set the error handling style.  "die" says to throw an exception on
           any POD formatting error.  "stderr" says to report errors on
           standard error, but not to throw an exception.  "pod" says to
           include a POD ERRORS section in the resulting documentation
           summarizing the errors.  "none" ignores POD errors entirely, as
           much as possible.

           The default is "die".

       ----ffiixxeedd=_f_o_n_t
           The fixed-width font to use for verbatim text and code.  Defaults
           to "CW".  Some systems may want "CR" instead.  Only matters for
           _t_r_o_f_f(1) output.

       ----ffiixxeeddbboolldd=_f_o_n_t
           Bold version of the fixed-width font.  Defaults to "CB".  Only
           matters for _t_r_o_f_f(1) output.

       ----ffiixxeeddiittaalliicc=_f_o_n_t
           Italic version of the fixed-width font (actually, something of a
           misnomer, since most fixed-width fonts only have an oblique
           version, not an italic version).  Defaults to "CI".  Only matters
           for _t_r_o_f_f(1) output.

       ----ffiixxeeddbboollddiittaalliicc=_f_o_n_t
           Bold italic (probably actually oblique) version of the fixed-width
           font.  Pod::Man doesn't assume you have this, and defaults to "CB".
           Some systems (such as Solaris) have this font available as "CX".
           Only matters for _t_r_o_f_f(1) output.

       --hh, ----hheellpp
           Print out usage information.

       --ll, ----llaaxx
           No longer used.  ppoodd22mmaann used to check its input for validity as a
           manual page, but this should now be done by _p_o_d_c_h_e_c_k_e_r(1) instead.
           Accepted for backward compatibility; this option no longer does
           anything.

       --nn _n_a_m_e, ----nnaammee=_n_a_m_e
           Set the name of the manual page to _n_a_m_e.  Without this option, the
           manual name is set to the uppercased base name of the file being
           converted unless the manual section is 3, in which case the path is
           parsed to see if it is a Perl module path.  If it is, a path like
           ".../lib/Pod/Man.pm" is converted into a name like "Pod::Man".
           This option, if given, overrides any automatic determination of the
           name.

           Note that this option is probably not useful when converting
           multiple POD files at once.  The convention for Unix man pages for
           commands is for the man page title to be in all-uppercase even if
           the command isn't.

       ----nnoouurrllss
           Normally, L<> formatting codes with a URL but anchor text are
           formatted to show both the anchor text and the URL.  In other
           words:

               L<foo|http://example.com/>

           is formatted as:

               foo <http://example.com/>

           This flag, if given, suppresses the URL when anchor text is given,
           so this example would be formatted as just "foo".  This can produce
           less cluttered output in cases where the URLs are not particularly
           important.

       --oo, ----ooffffiicciiaall
           Set the default header to indicate that this page is part of the
           standard Perl release, if ----cceenntteerr is not also given.

       --qq _q_u_o_t_e_s, ----qquuootteess=_q_u_o_t_e_s
           Sets the quote marks used to surround C<> text to _q_u_o_t_e_s.  If
           _q_u_o_t_e_s is a single character, it is used as both the left and right
           quote; if _q_u_o_t_e_s is two characters, the first character is used as
           the left quote and the second as the right quoted; and if _q_u_o_t_e_s is
           four characters, the first two are used as the left quote and the
           second two as the right quote.

           _q_u_o_t_e_s may also be set to the special value "none", in which case
           no quote marks are added around C<> text (but the font is still
           changed for troff output).

       --rr, ----rreelleeaassee
           Set the centered footer.  By default, this is the version of Perl
           you run ppoodd22mmaann under.  Note that some system an macro sets assume
           that the centered footer will be a modification date and will
           prepend something like "Last modified: "; if this is the case, you
           may want to set ----rreelleeaassee to the last modified date and ----ddaattee to
           the version number.

       --ss, ----sseeccttiioonn
           Set the section for the ".TH" macro.  The standard section
           numbering convention is to use 1 for user commands, 2 for system
           calls, 3 for functions, 4 for devices, 5 for file formats, 6 for
           games, 7 for miscellaneous information, and 8 for administrator
           commands.  There is a lot of variation here, however; some systems
           (like Solaris) use 4 for file formats, 5 for miscellaneous
           information, and 7 for devices.  Still others use 1m instead of 8,
           or some mix of both.  About the only section numbers that are
           reliably consistent are 1, 2, and 3.

           By default, section 1 will be used unless the file ends in ".pm",
           in which case section 3 will be selected.

       ----ssttddeerrrr
           By default, ppoodd22mmaann dies if any errors are detected in the POD
           input.  If ----ssttddeerrrr is given and no ----eerrrroorrss flag is present,
           errors are sent to standard error, but ppoodd22mmaann does not abort.
           This is equivalent to "--errors=stderr" and is supported for
           backward compatibility.

       --uu, ----uuttff88
           By default, ppoodd22mmaann produces the most conservative possible *roff
           output to try to ensure that it will work with as many different
           *roff implementations as possible.  Many *roff implementations
           cannot handle non-ASCII characters, so this means all non-ASCII
           characters are converted either to a *roff escape sequence that
           tries to create a properly accented character (at least for troff
           output) or to "X".

           This option says to instead output literal UTF-8 characters.  If
           your *roff implementation can handle it, this is the best output
           format to use and avoids corruption of documents containing non-
           ASCII characters.  However, be warned that *roff source with
           literal UTF-8 characters is not supported by many implementations
           and may even result in segfaults and other bad behavior.

           Be aware that, when using this option, the input encoding of your
           POD source must be properly declared unless it is US-ASCII or
           Latin-1.  POD input without an "=encoding" command will be assumed
           to be in Latin-1, and if it's actually in UTF-8, the output will be
           double-encoded.  See _p_e_r_l_p_o_d(1) for more information on the
           "=encoding" command.

       --vv, ----vveerrbboossee
           Print out the name of each output file as it is being generated.

EEXXIITT SSTTAATTUUSS
       As long as all documents processed result in some output, even if that
       output includes errata (a "POD ERRORS" section generated with
       "--errors=pod"), ppoodd22mmaann will exit with status 0.  If any of the
       documents being processed do not result in an output document, ppoodd22mmaann
       will exit with status 1.  If there are syntax errors in a POD document
       being processed and the error handling style is set to the default of
       "die", ppoodd22mmaann will abort immediately with exit status 255.

DDIIAAGGNNOOSSTTIICCSS
       If ppoodd22mmaann fails with errors, see Pod::Man and Pod::Simple for
       information about what those errors might mean.

       If you would like to print out a lot of man page continuously, you
       probably want to set the C and D registers to set contiguous page
       numbering and even/odd paging, at least on some versions of _m_a_n(7).

           troff -man -rC1 -rD1 perl.1 perldata.1 perlsyn.1 ...

       To get index entries on "STDERR", turn on the F register, as in:

           troff -man -rF1 perl.1

       The indexing merely outputs messages via ".tm" for each major page,
       section, subsection, item, and any "X<>" directives.  See Pod::Man for
       more details.
