       gzexe - compress executable files in place

       The  _g_z_e_x_e utility allows you to compress executables in place and have
       them automatically uncompress and execute  when  you  run  them  (at  a
       penalty   in   performance).    For  example  if  you  execute  ``gzexe
       /usr/bin/gdb'' it will create the following two files:
           -rwxr-xr-x  1 root root 1026675 Jun  7 13:53 /usr/bin/gdb
           -rwxr-xr-x  1 root root 2304524 May 30 13:02 /usr/bin/gdb~
       /usr/bin/gdb~ is the original file and /usr/bin/gdb is the  self-uncom-
       pressing  executable  file.   You can remove /usr/bin/gdb~ once you are
       sure that /usr/bin/gdb works properly.

       This utility is most useful on systems with very small disks.

CCAAVVEEAATTSS
       The compressed executable is a shell  script.   This  may  create  some
       security holes.  In particular, the compressed executable relies on the
       PATH environment variable to find  _g_z_i_p  and  some  standard  utilities
       (_b_a_s_e_n_a_m_e, _c_h_m_o_d, _l_n, _m_k_d_i_r, _m_k_t_e_m_p, _r_m, _s_l_e_e_p, and _t_a_i_l).

BBUUGGSS
       _g_z_e_x_e attempts to retain the original file attributes on the compressed
       executable, but you may have to fix them manually in some cases,  using
       _c_h_m_o_d or _c_h_o_w_n.
