       faked  -  daemon  that  remembers  fake  ownership/permissions of files
       manipulated by fakeroot processes.

       If  a  fakeroot  process  wants to change the ownership of a file, then
       ffaakkeedd is the process that remembers that new owner. If later  the  same
       fakeroot  process does a stat() for that filename, then the libfakeroot
       wrapped stat() call will first ask faked for the fake ownership etc  of
       that file, and then report it.

              Don't  allocate  a  new  communication  channel, but use channel
              specified by key. (If the specified channel doesn't exist,  it's
              created).

       None so far. Be warned, though: although I've written quite a few  much
       larger  (and smaller) programs, I've never written anything that was as
       tiny as ffaakkeerroooott, had as many bugs as ffaakkeerroooott, and still was as usable
       as,  say,  ffaakkeerroooott version 0.0_3, the first version that could be used
       to build itself.
