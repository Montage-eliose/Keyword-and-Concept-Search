       "rename" renames the filenames supplied according to the rule specified
       as the first argument.  The _p_e_r_l_e_x_p_r argument is a Perl expression
       which is expected to modify the $_ string in Perl for at least some of
       the filenames specified.  If a given filename is not modified by the
       expression, it will not be renamed.  If no filenames are given on the
       command line, filenames will be read via standard input.

       For example, to rename all files matching "*.bak" to strip the
       extension, you might say

               rename 's/\.bak$//' *.bak

       To translate uppercase names to lower, you'd use

               rename 'y/A-Z/a-z/' *

       If you give an invalid Perl expression you'll get a syntax error.

       The original "rename" did not check for the existence of target
       filenames, so had to be used with care.  I hope I've fixed that (Robin
       Barker).
