       _Z_l_e_s_s  is a filter which allows examination of compressed or plain text
       files one screenful at a time on  a  soft-copy  terminal.   It  is  the
       equivalent of setting the environment variable LESSOPEN to '|gzip -cdfq
       --   %s',   and   the    environment    variable    LESSMETACHARS    to
       '<space><tab><newline>;*?"()<>[|&^`#\$%=~',   and  then  running  _l_e_s_s.
       However, enough people seem to think  that  having  the  command  _z_l_e_s_s
       available is important to be worth providing it.

BBUUGGSS
       _Z_l_e_s_s  does not work with compressed data that is piped to it via stan-
       dard input; it requires that input files be specified as arguments.  To
       read  compressed  data from a pipe, you can use ...||gguunnzziipp||lleessss instead
       of ...||zzlleessss.
