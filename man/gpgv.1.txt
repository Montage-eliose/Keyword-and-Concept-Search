DDEESSCCRRIIPPTTIIOONN
       ggppggvv is an OpenPGP signature verification tool.

       This  program  is actually a stripped-down version of ggppgg which is only
       able to check signatures. It is somewhat smaller than  the  fully-blown
       ggppgg  and  uses  a  different (and simpler) way to check that the public
       keys used to make the signature are valid. There are  no  configuration
       files and only a few options are implemented.

       ggppggvv  assumes  that all keys in the keyring are trustworthy.  That does
       also mean that it does not check for expired or revoked keys.

       By default a keyring named '_t_r_u_s_t_e_d_k_e_y_s_._g_p_g'  is  used.   This  default
       keyring  is  assumed  to  be in the home directory of GnuPG, either the
       default home directory or the one set by an option  or  an  environment
       variable.   The  option  ----kkeeyyrriinngg  may  be used to specify a different
       keyring or even multiple keyrings.

       The program returns 0 if everything is fine, 1 if at least  one  signa-
       ture was bad, and other error codes for fatal errors.


OOPPTTIIOONNSS
       ggppggvv recognizes these options:



       ----vveerrbboossee

       --vv     Gives  more  information  during  processing. If used twice, the
              input data is listed in detail.


       ----qquuiieett

       --qq     Try to be as quiet as possible.


       ----kkeeyyrriinngg _f_i_l_e
              Add _f_i_l_e to the list of keyrings.  If _f_i_l_e begins with  a  tilde
              and  a  slash,  these are replaced by the HOME directory. If the
              filename does not contain a slash, it is assumed to  be  in  the
              home-directory ("~/.gnupg" if --homedir is not used).


       ----ssttaattuuss--ffdd _n
              Write  special status strings to the file descriptor _n.  See the
              file DETAILS in the documentation for a listing of them.


       ----llooggggeerr--ffdd nn
              Write log output to file descriptor nn and not to stderr.


       ----iiggnnoorree--ttiimmee--ccoonnfflliicctt
              GnuPG normally checks that the timestamps associated  with  keys
              and  signatures have plausible values. However, sometimes a sig-
              nature seems to be older than the key  due  to  clock  problems.
              This option turns these checks into warnings.


       ----hhoommeeddiirr _d_i_r
              Set the name of the home directory to _d_i_r. If this option is not
              used, the home directory defaults to  '_~_/_._g_n_u_p_g'.   It  is  only
              recognized  when  given  on the command line.  It also overrides
              any home  directory  stated  through  the  environment  variable
              '_G_N_U_P_G_H_O_M_E'  or  (on  Windows  systems) by means of the Registry
              entry _H_K_C_U_\_S_o_f_t_w_a_r_e_\_G_N_U_\_G_n_u_P_G_:_H_o_m_e_D_i_r.

              On Windows systems it is possible to install GnuPG as a portable
              application.  In this case only this command line option is con-
              sidered, all other ways to set a home directory are ignored.

              To install GnuPG as a portable application under Windows, create
              an  empty  file  name '_g_p_g_c_o_n_f_._c_t_l' in the same directory as the
              tool '_g_p_g_c_o_n_f_._e_x_e'.  The root of the installation is  than  that
              directory;  or,  if  '_g_p_g_c_o_n_f_._e_x_e'  has  been installed directly
              below a directory named '_b_i_n', its parent directory.   You  also
              need  to  make sure that the following directories exist and are
              writable:    '_R_O_O_T_/_h_o_m_e'    for    the    GnuPG     home     and
              '_R_O_O_T_/_v_a_r_/_c_a_c_h_e_/_g_n_u_p_g' for internal cache files.

       ggppggvv ssiiggffiillee [ddaattaaffiillee]
              Verify  the  signature  of the file. The second form is used for
              detached signatures, where ssiiggffiillee  is  the  detached  signature
              (either  ASCII-armored  or  binary)  and  ddaattaaffiillee  contains the
              signed data; if ddaattaaffiillee is "-" the signed data is  expected  on
              ssttddiinn; if ddaattaaffiillee is not given the name of the file holding the
              signed data is constructed by cutting off the extension (".asc",
              ".sig" or ".sign") from ssiiggffiillee.

       The full documentation for this tool is maintained as a Texinfo manual.
       If GnuPG and the info program are properly installed at your site,  the
       command

         info gnupg

       should  give  you access to the complete manual including a menu struc-
