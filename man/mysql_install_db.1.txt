       mysql_install_db - initialize MySQL data directory

       mmyyssqqll__iinnssttaallll__ddbb initializes the MySQL data directory and creates the
       system tables that it contains, if they do not exist.  mmyyssqqll__iinnssttaallll__ddbb
       is a shell script and is available only on Unix platforms. (As of MySQL
       5.6, mmyyssqqll__iinnssttaallll__ddbb is a Perl script and can be used on any system
       with Perl installed.)

       To invoke mmyyssqqll__iinnssttaallll__ddbb, use the following syntax:

           shell> mmyyssqqll__iinnssttaallll__ddbb [[_o_p_t_i_o_n_s]]

       Because the MySQL server, mmyyssqqlldd, must access the data directory when
       it runs later, you should either run mmyyssqqll__iinnssttaallll__ddbb from the same
       system account that will be used for running mmyyssqqlldd, or run it as root
       and specify the ----uusseerr option to indicate the user name that mmyyssqqlldd
       will run as. It might be necessary to specify other options such as
       ----bbaasseeddiirr or ----ddaattaaddiirr if mmyyssqqll__iinnssttaallll__ddbb does not use the correct
       locations for the installation directory or data directory. For
       example:

           shell> ssccrriippttss//mmyyssqqll__iinnssttaallll__ddbb ----uusseerr==mmyyssqqll \\
                    ----bbaasseeddiirr==//oopptt//mmyyssqqll//mmyyssqqll \\
                    ----ddaattaaddiirr==//oopptt//mmyyssqqll//mmyyssqqll//ddaattaa


           NNoottee
           If you have set a custom TMPDIR environment variable when
           performing the installation, and the specified directory is not
           accessible, mmyyssqqll__iinnssttaallll__ddbb may fail. If so, unset TMPDIR or set
           TMPDIR to point to the system temporary directory (usually /tmp).

       mmyyssqqll__iinnssttaallll__ddbb supports the following options, which can be specified
       on the command line or in the [mysql_install_db] group of an option
       file. (Options that are common to mmyyssqqlldd can also be specified in the
       [mysqld] group.) Other options are passed to mmyyssqqlldd. For information
       about option files used by MySQL programs, see Section 4.2.6, "Using
       Option Files".

       +o   ----hheellpp

           Display a help message and exit.

       +o   ----bbaasseeddiirr==_d_i_r___n_a_m_e

           The path to the MySQL installation directory.

       +o   ----bbuuiillddddiirr==_d_i_r___n_a_m_e

           For use with ----ssrrccddiirr and out-of-source builds. Set this to the
           location of the directory where the built files reside.

       +o   ----ccrroossss--bboooottssttrraapp

           For internal use. This option is used for building system tables on
           one host intended for another.

       +o   ----ddaattaaddiirr==_d_i_r___n_a_m_e

           The path to the MySQL data directory.

       +o   ----ddeeffaauullttss--eexxttrraa--ffiillee==_f_i_l_e___n_a_m_e

           Read this option file after the global option file but (on Unix)
           before the user option file. If the file does not exist or is
           otherwise inaccessible, an error occurs.  _f_i_l_e___n_a_m_e is interpreted
           relative to the current directory if given as a relative path name
           rather than a full path name.

       +o   ----ddeeffaauullttss--ffiillee==_f_i_l_e___n_a_m_e

           Use only the given option file. If the file does not exist or is
           otherwise inaccessible, an error occurs.  _f_i_l_e___n_a_m_e is interpreted
           relative to the current directory if given as a relative path name
           rather than a full path name.

       +o   ----ffoorrccee

           Cause mmyyssqqll__iinnssttaallll__ddbb to run even if DNS does not work. Grant
           table entries normally created using host names will use IP
           addresses instead.

       +o   ----llddaattaa==_d_i_r___n_a_m_e

           A synonym for ----ddaattaaddiirr.

       +o   ----nnoo--ddeeffaauullttss

           Do not read any option files. If program startup fails due to
           reading unknown options from an option file, ----nnoo--ddeeffaauullttss can be
           used to prevent them from being read.

       +o   ----rrppmm

           For internal use. This option is used during the MySQL installation
           process for install operations performed using RPM packages.

       +o   ----sskkiipp--nnaammee--rreessoollvvee

           Use IP addresses rather than host names when creating grant table
           entries. This option can be useful if your DNS does not work.

       +o   ----ssrrccddiirr==_d_i_r___n_a_m_e

           For internal use. This option specifies the directory under which
           mmyyssqqll__iinnssttaallll__ddbb looks for support files such as the error message
           file and the file for populating the help tables.

       +o   ----uusseerr==_u_s_e_r___n_a_m_e

           The system (login) user name to use for running mmyyssqqlldd. Files and
           directories created by mmyyssqqlldd will be owned by this user. You must
           be the system root user to use this option. By default, mmyyssqqlldd runs
           using your current login name and files and directories that it
           creates will be owned by you.

       +o   ----vveerrbboossee

           Verbose mode. Print more information about what the program does.

       +o   ----wwiinnddoowwss

           For internal use. This option is used for creating Windows
           distributions.
