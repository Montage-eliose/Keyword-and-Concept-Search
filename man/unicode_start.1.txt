       The  uunniiccooddee__ssttaarrtt  command will put the keyboard and console into Uni-
       code (UTF-8) mode.

       For the keyboard this means that one can attach 16-bit U+xxxx values to
       keyboard  keys  using llooaaddkkeeyyss(1), and have these appear as UTF-8 input
       to user programs.  Also, that one can type hexadecimal  Alt-xxxx  using
       the numeric keypad, and again produce UTF-8.

       For  the  console  this means that the kernel expects UTF-8 output from
       user programs, and displays the output accordingly.

       The parameter _f_o_n_t is a font that is loaded. It should have a  built-in
       Unicode  map,  or,  if it hasn't, such a map can be given explicitly as
       second parameter.  When no font was  specified,  the  current  font  is
       kept.

NNOOTTEE
       Unicode mode is a parameter with a value per virtual console.  However,
       usually the font and keymap is common to all consoles.
