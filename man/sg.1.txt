NNAAMMEE
       sg - execute command as different group ID

SSYYNNOOPPSSIISS
       ssgg [-] [group [-c ] command]

DDEESSCCRRIIPPTTIIOONN
       The ssgg command works similar to nneewwggrrpp but accepts a command. The
       command will be executed with the /bin/sh shell. With most shells you
       may run ssgg from, you need to enclose multi-word commands in quotes.
       Another difference between nneewwggrrpp and ssgg is that some shells treat
       nneewwggrrpp specially, replacing themselves with a new instance of a shell
       that nneewwggrrpp creates. This doesn't happen with ssgg, so upon exit from a
       ssgg command you are returned to your previous group ID.
