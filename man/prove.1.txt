       If _~_/_._p_r_o_v_e_r_c or _._/_._p_r_o_v_e_r_c exist they will be read and any options
       they contain processed before the command line options. Options in
       _._p_r_o_v_e_r_c are specified in the same way as command line options:

           # .proverc
           --state=hot,fast,save
           -j9

       Additional option files may be specified with the "--rc" option.
       Default option file processing is disabled by the "--norc" option.

       Under Windows and VMS the option file is named ___p_r_o_v_e_r_c rather than
       _._p_r_o_v_e_r_c and is sought only in the current directory.

       If you have a list of tests (or URLs, or anything else you want to
       test) in a file, you can add them to your tests by using a '-':

        prove - < my_list_of_things_to_test.txt

       See the "README" in the "examples" directory of this distribution.

   DDeeffaauulltt TTeesstt DDiirreeccttoorryy
       If no files or directories are supplied, "prove" looks for all files
       matching the pattern "t/*.t".

       Colored test output is the default, but if output is not to a terminal,
       color is disabled. You can override this by adding the "--color"
       switch.

       Color support requires Term::ANSIColor on Unix-like platforms and
       Win32::Console windows. If the necessary module is not installed
       colored output will not be available.

   EExxiitt CCooddee
       If the tests fail "prove" will exit with non-zero status.

   AArrgguummeennttss ttoo TTeessttss
       It is possible to supply arguments to tests. To do so separate them
       from prove's own arguments with the arisdottle, '::'. For example

        prove -v t/mytest.t :: --url http://example.com

       would run _t_/_m_y_t_e_s_t_._t with the options '--url http://example.com'.  When
       running multiple tests they will each receive the same arguments.

   ""----eexxeecc""
       Normally you can just pass a list of Perl tests and the harness will
       know how to execute them.  However, if your tests are not written in
       Perl or if you want all tests invoked exactly the same way, use the
       "-e", or "--exec" switch:

        prove --exec '/usr/bin/ruby -w' t/
        prove --exec '/usr/bin/perl -Tw -mstrict -Ilib' t/
        prove --exec '/path/to/my/customer/exec'

   ""----mmeerrggee""
       If you need to make sure your diagnostics are displayed in the correct
       order relative to test results you can use the "--merge" option to
       merge the test scripts' STDERR into their STDOUT.

       This guarantees that STDOUT (where the test results appear) and STDERR
       (where the diagnostics appear) will stay in sync. The harness will
       display any diagnostics your tests emit on STDERR.

       Caveat: this is a bit of a kludge. In particular note that if anything
       that appears on STDERR looks like a test result the test harness will
       get confused. Use this option only if you understand the consequences
       and can live with the risk.

   ""----ttrraapp""
       The "--trap" option will attempt to trap SIGINT (Ctrl-C) during a test
       run and display the test summary even if the run is interrupted

   ""----ssttaattee""
       You can ask "prove" to remember the state of previous test runs and
       select and/or order the tests to be run based on that saved state.

       The "--state" switch requires an argument which must be a comma
       separated list of one or more of the following options.

       "last"
           Run the same tests as the last time the state was saved. This makes
           it possible, for example, to recreate the ordering of a shuffled
           test.

               # Run all tests in random order
               $ prove -b --state=save --shuffle

               # Run them again in the same order
               $ prove -b --state=last

       "failed"
           Run only the tests that failed on the last run.

               # Run all tests
               $ prove -b --state=save

               # Run failures
               $ prove -b --state=failed

           If you also specify the "save" option newly passing tests will be
           excluded from subsequent runs.

               # Repeat until no more failures
               $ prove -b --state=failed,save

       "passed"
           Run only the passed tests from last time. Useful to make sure that
           no new problems have been introduced.

       "all"
           Run all tests in normal order. Multple options may be specified, so
           to run all tests with the failures from last time first:

               $ prove -b --state=failed,all,save

       "hot"
           Run the tests that most recently failed first. The last failure
           time of each test is stored. The "hot" option causes tests to be
           run in most-recent- failure order.

               $ prove -b --state=hot,save

           Tests that have never failed will not be selected. To run all tests
           with the most recently failed first use

               $ prove -b --state=hot,all,save

           This combination of options may also be specified thus

               $ prove -b --state=adrian

       "todo"
           Run any tests with todos.

       "slow"
           Run the tests in slowest to fastest order. This is useful in
           conjunction with the "-j" parallel testing switch to ensure that
           your slowest tests start running first.

               $ prove -b --state=slow -j9

       "fast"
           Run test tests in fastest to slowest order.

       "new"
           Run the tests in newest to oldest order based on the modification
           times of the test scripts.

       "old"
           Run the tests in oldest to newest order.

       "fresh"
           Run those test scripts that have been modified since the last test
           run.

       "save"
           Save the state on exit. The state is stored in a file called _._p_r_o_v_e
           (___p_r_o_v_e on Windows and VMS) in the current directory.

       The "--state" switch may be used more than once.

           $ prove -b --state=hot --state=all,save

   @@IINNCC
       prove introduces a separation between "options passed to the perl which
       runs prove" and "options passed to the perl which runs tests"; this
       distinction is by design. Thus the perl which is running a test starts
       with the default @INC. Additional library directories can be added via
       the "PERL5LIB" environment variable, via -Ifoo in "PERL5OPT" or via the
       "-Ilib" option to _p_r_o_v_e.

   TTaaiinntt MMooddee
       Normally when a Perl program is run in taint mode the contents of the
       "PERL5LIB" environment variable do not appear in @INC.

       Because "PERL5LIB" is often used during testing to add build
       directories to @INC prove passes the names of any directories found in
       "PERL5LIB" as -I switches. The net effect of this is that "PERL5LIB" is
       honoured even when prove is run in taint mode.

FFOORRMMAATTTTEERRSS
       You can load a custom TAP::Parser::Formatter:

         prove --formatter MyFormatter

SSOOUURRCCEE HHAANNDDLLEERRSS
       You can load custom TAP::Parser::SourceHandlers, to change the way the
       parser interprets particular _s_o_u_r_c_e_s of TAP.

         prove --source MyHandler --source YetAnother t

       If you want to provide config to the source you can use:

         prove --source MyCustom \
               --source Perl --perl-option 'foo=bar baz' --perl-option avg=0.278 \
               --source File --file-option extensions=.txt --file-option extensions=.tmp t
               --source pgTAP --pgtap-option pset=format=html --pgtap-option pset=border=2

       Each "--$source-option" option must specify a key/value pair separated
       by an "=". If an option can take multiple values, just specify it
       multiple times, as with the "extensions=" examples above. If the option
       should be a hash reference, specify the value as a second pair
       separated by a "=", as in the "pset=" examples above (escape "=" with a
       backslash).

       All "--sources" are combined into a hash, and passed to "new" in
       TAP::Harness's "sources" parameter.

       See TAP::Parser::IteratorFactory for more details on how configuration
       is passed to _S_o_u_r_c_e_H_a_n_d_l_e_r_s.

PPLLUUGGIINNSS
       Plugins can be loaded using the "-P_p_l_u_g_i_n_" syntax, eg:

         prove -PMyPlugin

       This will search for a module named "App::Prove::Plugin::MyPlugin", or
       failing that, "MyPlugin".  If the plugin can't be found, "prove" will
       complain & exit.

       You can pass arguments to your plugin by appending "=arg1,arg2,etc" to
       the plugin name:

         prove -PMyPlugin=fou,du,fafa

       Please check individual plugin documentation for more details.
