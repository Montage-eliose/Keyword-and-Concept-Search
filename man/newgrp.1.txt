       The nneewwggrrpp command is used to change the current group ID during a
       login session. If the optional -- flag is given, the user's environment
       will be reinitialized as though the user had logged in, otherwise the
       current environment, including current working directory, remains
       unchanged.

       nneewwggrrpp changes the current real group ID to the named group, or to the
       default group listed in /etc/passwd if no group name is given.  nneewwggrrpp
       also tries to add the group to the user groupset. If not root, the user
       will be prompted for a password if she does not have a password (in
       /etc/shadow if this user has an entry in the shadowed password file, or
       in /etc/passwd otherwise) and the group does, or if the user is not
       listed as a member and the group has a password. The user will be
       denied access if the group password is empty and the user is not listed
       as a member.

       If there is an entry for this group in /etc/gshadow, then the list of
       members and the password of this group will be taken from this file,
       otherwise, the entry in /etc/group is considered.
