       The  command cchhvvtt _N makes _/_d_e_v_/_t_t_y_N the foreground terminal.  (The cor-
       responding screen is created if it did not exist yet.  To  get  rid  of
       unused  VTs,  use ddeeaallllooccvvtt(1).)  The key combination (Ctrl-)LeftAlt-F_N
       (with _N in the range 1-12) usually has a similar effect.
