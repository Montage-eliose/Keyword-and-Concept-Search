       ww  displays  information  about the users currently on the machine, and
       their processes.  The header shows, in this order,  the  current  time,
       how  long  the  system  has  been running, how many users are currently
       logged on, and the system load averages for the past 1, 5, and 15  min-
       utes.

       The  following entries are displayed for each user: login name, the tty
       name, the remote host, login time, idle time, JCPU, PCPU, and the  com-
       mand line of their current process.

       The  JCPU  time  is the time used by all processes attached to the tty.
       It does not include past background jobs, but  does  include  currently
       running background jobs.

       The  PCPU  time  is  the time used by the current process, named in the
       "what" field.

              Ignores the username while figuring out the current process  and
              cpu times.  To demonstrate this, do a "su" and do a "w" and a "w
              -u".

       --ss, ----sshhoorrtt
              Use the short format.  Don't print the login time, JCPU or  PCPU

       --ff, ----ffrroomm
              Toggle  printing  the ffrroomm (remote hostname) field.  The default
              as released is for the ffrroomm field to not  be  printed,  although
              your  system  administrator  or distribution maintainer may have
              compiled a version in which the ffrroomm field is shown by default.
