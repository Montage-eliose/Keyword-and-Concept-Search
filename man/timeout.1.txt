       Start COMMAND, and kill it if still running after DURATION.

       Mandatory  arguments  to  long  options are mandatory for short options
       too.

       ----pprreesseerrvvee--ssttaattuuss

              exit with the same status as  COMMAND,  even  when  the  command
              times out

       ----ffoorreeggrroouunndd

              When  not  running  timeout  directly from a shell prompt, allow
              COMMAND to read from the TTY and receive TTY signals.   In  this
              mode, children of COMMAND will not be timed out.

       --kk, ----kkiillll--aafftteerr=_D_U_R_A_T_I_O_N

              also  send  a  KILL signal if COMMAND is still running this long
              after the initial signal was sent.

       --ss, ----ssiiggnnaall=_S_I_G_N_A_L

              specify the signal to be sent on timeout.  SIGNAL may be a  name
              like 'HUP' or a number.  See 'kill --ll' for a list of signals

       ----hheellpp
              display this help and exit

       ----vveerrssiioonn
              output version information and exit

       DURATION  is  a  floating point number with an optional suffix: 's' for
       seconds (the default), 'm' for minutes, 'h' for hours or 'd' for days.

       If the command times out, and ----pprreesseerrvvee--ssttaattuuss is not set,  then  exit
       with  status  124.   Otherwise, exit with the status of COMMAND.  If no
       signal is specified, send the TERM signal upon timeout.  The TERM  sig-
       nal kills any process that does not block or catch that signal.  It may
       be necessary to use the KILL (9) signal, since this  signal  cannot  be
       caught, in which case the exit status is 128+9 rather than 124.
