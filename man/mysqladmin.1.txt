DDEESSCCRRIIPPTTIIOONN
       mmyyssqqllaaddmmiinn is a client for performing administrative operations. You
       can use it to check the server's configuration and current status, to
       create and drop databases, and more.

       Invoke mmyyssqqllaaddmmiinn like this:

           shell> mmyyssqqllaaddmmiinn [[_o_p_t_i_o_n_s]] _c_o_m_m_a_n_d [[_c_o_m_m_a_n_d_-_a_r_g]] [[_c_o_m_m_a_n_d [[_c_o_m_m_a_n_d_-_a_r_g]]]] ......

       mmyyssqqllaaddmmiinn supports the following commands. Some of the commands take
       an argument following the command name.

       +o   create _d_b___n_a_m_e

           Create a new database named _d_b___n_a_m_e.

       +o   debug

           Tell the server to write debug information to the error log. Format
           and content of this information is subject to change.

           This includes information about the Event Scheduler. See
           Section 20.4.5, "Event Scheduler Status".

       +o   drop _d_b___n_a_m_e

           Delete the database named _d_b___n_a_m_e and all its tables.

       +o   extended-status

           Display the server status variables and their values.

       +o   flush-hosts

           Flush all information in the host cache.

       +o   flush-logs

           Flush all logs.

       +o   flush-privileges

           Reload the grant tables (same as reload).

       +o   flush-status

           Clear status variables.

       +o   flush-tables

           Flush all tables.

       +o   flush-threads

           Flush the thread cache.

       +o   kill _i_d,_i_d,...

           Kill server threads. If multiple thread ID values are given, there
           must be no spaces in the list.

       +o   old-password _n_e_w___p_a_s_s_w_o_r_d

           This is like the password command but stores the password using the
           old (pre-4.1) password-hashing format. (See Section 6.1.2.4,
           "Password Hashing in MySQL".)

       +o   password _n_e_w___p_a_s_s_w_o_r_d

           Set a new password. This changes the password to _n_e_w___p_a_s_s_w_o_r_d for
           the account that you use with mmyyssqqllaaddmmiinn for connecting to the
           server. Thus, the next time you invoke mmyyssqqllaaddmmiinn (or any other
           client program) using the same account, you will need to specify
           the new password.

           If the _n_e_w___p_a_s_s_w_o_r_d value contains spaces or other characters that
           are special to your command interpreter, you need to enclose it
           within quotation marks. On Windows, be sure to use double quotation
           marks rather than single quotation marks; single quotation marks
           are not stripped from the password, but rather are interpreted as
           part of the password. For example:

               shell> mmyyssqqllaaddmmiinn ppaasssswwoorrdd ""mmyy nneeww ppaasssswwoorrdd""

           As of MySQL 5.5.3, the new password can be omitted following the
           password command. In this case, mmyyssqqllaaddmmiinn prompts for the password
           value, which enables you to avoid specifying the password on the
           command line. Omitting the password value should be done only if
           password is the final command on the mmyyssqqllaaddmmiinn command line.
           Otherwise, the next argument is taken as the password.

               CCaauuttiioonn
               Do not use this command used if the server was started with the
               ----sskkiipp--ggrraanntt--ttaabblleess option. No password change will be applied.
               This is true even if you precede the password command with
               flush-privileges on the same command line to re-enable the
               grant tables because the flush operation occurs after you
               connect. However, you can use mmyyssqqllaaddmmiinn fflluusshh--pprriivviilleeggeess to
               re-enable the grant table and then use a separate mmyyssqqllaaddmmiinn
               ppaasssswwoorrdd command to change the password.

       +o   ping

           Check whether the server is available. The return status from
           mmyyssqqllaaddmmiinn is 0 if the server is running, 1 if it is not. This is 0
           even in case of an error such as Access denied, because this means
           that the server is running but refused the connection, which is
           different from the server not running.

       +o   processlist

           Show a list of active server threads. This is like the output of
           the SHOW PROCESSLIST statement. If the ----vveerrbboossee option is given,
           the output is like that of SHOW FULL PROCESSLIST. (See
           Section 13.7.5.30, "SHOW PROCESSLIST Syntax".)

       +o   reload

           Reload the grant tables.

       +o   refresh

           Flush all tables and close and open log files.

       +o   shutdown

           Stop the server.

       +o   start-slave

           Start replication on a slave server.

       +o   status

           Display a short server status message.

       +o   stop-slave

           Stop replication on a slave server.

       +o   variables

           Display the server system variables and their values.

       +o   version

           Display version information from the server.

       All commands can be shortened to any unique prefix. For example:

           shell> mmyyssqqllaaddmmiinn pprroocc ssttaatt
           +----+-------+-----------+----+---------+------+-------+------------------+
           | Id | User  | Host      | db | Command | Time | State | Info             |
           +----+-------+-----------+----+---------+------+-------+------------------+
           | 51 | monty | localhost |    | Query   | 0    |       | show processlist |
           +----+-------+-----------+----+---------+------+-------+------------------+
           Uptime: 1473624  Threads: 1  Questions: 39487
           Slow queries: 0  Opens: 541  Flush tables: 1
           Open tables: 19  Queries per second avg: 0.0268


       The mmyyssqqllaaddmmiinn ssttaattuuss command result displays the following values:

       +o   Uptime

           The number of seconds the MySQL server has been running.

       +o   Threads

           The number of active threads (clients).

       +o   Questions

           The number of questions (queries) from clients since the server was
           started.

       +o   Slow queries

           The number of queries that have taken more than long_query_time
           seconds. See Section 5.2.5, "The Slow Query Log".

       +o   Opens

           The number of tables the server has opened.

       +o   Flush tables

           The number of flush-*, refresh, and reload commands the server has
           executed.

       +o   Open tables

           The number of tables that currently are open.

       +o   Memory in use

           The amount of memory allocated directly by mmyyssqqlldd. This value is
           displayed only when MySQL has been compiled with safemalloc, which
           is available only before MySQL 5.5.6.

       +o   Maximum memory used

           The maximum amount of memory allocated directly by mmyyssqqlldd. This
           value is displayed only when MySQL has been compiled with
           safemalloc, which is available only before MySQL 5.5.6.

       If you execute mmyyssqqllaaddmmiinn sshhuuttddoowwnn when connecting to a local server
       using a Unix socket file, mmyyssqqllaaddmmiinn waits until the server's process
       ID file has been removed, to ensure that the server has stopped
       properly.

       mmyyssqqllaaddmmiinn supports the following options, which can be specified on
       the command line or in the [mysqladmin] and [client] groups of an
       option file. For information about option files used by MySQL programs,
       see Section 4.2.6, "Using Option Files".

       +o   ----hheellpp, --??

           Display a help message and exit.

       +o   ----bbiinndd--aaddddrreessss==_i_p___a_d_d_r_e_s_s

           On a computer having multiple network interfaces, use this option
           to select which interface to use for connecting to the MySQL
           server.

           This option is supported only in the version of mmyyssqqllaaddmmiinn that is
           supplied with MySQL Cluster. It is not available in standard MySQL
           Server 5.5 releases.

       +o   ----cchhaarraacctteerr--sseettss--ddiirr==_d_i_r___n_a_m_e

           The directory where character sets are installed. See Section 10.5,
           "Character Set Configuration".

       +o   ----ccoommpprreessss, --CC

           Compress all information sent between the client and the server if
           both support compression.

       +o   ----ccoouunntt==_N, --cc _N

           The number of iterations to make for repeated command execution if
           the ----sslleeeepp option is given.

       +o   ----ddeebbuugg[[==_d_e_b_u_g___o_p_t_i_o_n_s]], --## [[_d_e_b_u_g___o_p_t_i_o_n_s]]

           Write a debugging log. A typical _d_e_b_u_g___o_p_t_i_o_n_s string is
           d:t:o,_f_i_l_e___n_a_m_e. The default is d:t:o,/tmp/mysqladmin.trace.

       +o   ----ddeebbuugg--cchheecckk

           Print some debugging information when the program exits.

       +o   ----ddeebbuugg--iinnffoo

           Print debugging information and memory and CPU usage statistics
           when the program exits.

       +o   ----ddeeffaauulltt--aauutthh==_p_l_u_g_i_n

           A hint about the client-side authentication plugin to use. See
           Section 6.3.6, "Pluggable Authentication".

           This option was added in MySQL 5.5.9.

       +o   ----ddeeffaauulltt--cchhaarraacctteerr--sseett==_c_h_a_r_s_e_t___n_a_m_e

           Use _c_h_a_r_s_e_t___n_a_m_e as the default character set. See Section 10.5,
           "Character Set Configuration".

       +o   ----ddeeffaauullttss--eexxttrraa--ffiillee==_f_i_l_e___n_a_m_e

           Read this option file after the global option file but (on Unix)
           before the user option file. If the file does not exist or is
           otherwise inaccessible, an error occurs. Before MySQL 5.5.8,
           _f_i_l_e___n_a_m_e must be the full path name to the file. As of MySQL
           5.5.8, the name is interpreted relative to the current directory if
           given as a relative path name.

       +o   ----ddeeffaauullttss--ffiillee==_f_i_l_e___n_a_m_e

           Use only the given option file. If the file does not exist or is
           otherwise inaccessible, an error occurs. Before MySQL 5.5.8,
           _f_i_l_e___n_a_m_e must be the full path name to the file. As of MySQL
           5.5.8, the name is interpreted relative to the current directory if
           given as a relative path name.

       +o   ----ddeeffaauullttss--ggrroouupp--ssuuffffiixx==_s_t_r

           Read not only the usual option groups, but also groups with the
           usual names and a suffix of _s_t_r. For example, mmyyssqqllaaddmmiinn normally
           reads the [client] and [mysqladmin] groups. If the
           ----ddeeffaauullttss--ggrroouupp--ssuuffffiixx==__ootthheerr option is given, mmyyssqqllaaddmmiinn also
           reads the [client_other] and [mysqladmin_other] groups.

       +o   ----eennaabbllee--cclleeaarrtteexxtt--pplluuggiinn

           Enable the mysql_clear_password cleartext authentication plugin.
           (See Section 6.4.1.5, "The Cleartext Client-Side Authentication
           Plugin".) This option was added in MySQL 5.5.27.

       +o   ----ffoorrccee, --ff

           Do not ask for confirmation for the drop _d_b___n_a_m_e command. With
           multiple commands, continue even if an error occurs.

       +o   ----hhoosstt==_h_o_s_t___n_a_m_e, --hh _h_o_s_t___n_a_m_e

           Connect to the MySQL server on the given host.

       +o   ----nnoo--bbeeeepp, --bb

           Suppress the warning beep that is emitted by default for errors
           such as a failure to connect to the server.

       +o   ----nnoo--ddeeffaauullttss

           Do not read any option files. If program startup fails due to
           reading unknown options from an option file, ----nnoo--ddeeffaauullttss can be
           used to prevent them from being read.

       +o   ----ppaasssswwoorrdd[[==_p_a_s_s_w_o_r_d]], --pp[[_p_a_s_s_w_o_r_d]]

           The password to use when connecting to the server. If you use the
           short option form (--pp), you _c_a_n_n_o_t have a space between the option
           and the password. If you omit the _p_a_s_s_w_o_r_d value following the
           ----ppaasssswwoorrdd or --pp option on the command line, mmyyssqqllaaddmmiinn prompts for
           one.

           Specifying a password on the command line should be considered
           insecure. See Section 6.1.2.1, "End-User Guidelines for Password
           Security". You can use an option file to avoid giving the password
           on the command line.

       +o   ----ppiippee, --WW

           On Windows, connect to the server using a named pipe. This option
           applies only if the server supports named-pipe connections.

       +o   ----pplluuggiinn--ddiirr==_d_i_r___n_a_m_e

           The directory in which to look for plugins. Specify this option if
           the ----ddeeffaauulltt--aauutthh option is used to specify an authentication
           plugin but mmyyssqqllaaddmmiinn does not find it. See Section 6.3.6,
           "Pluggable Authentication".

           This option was added in MySQL 5.5.9.

       +o   ----ppoorrtt==_p_o_r_t___n_u_m, --PP _p_o_r_t___n_u_m

           The TCP/IP port number to use for the connection.

       +o   ----pprriinntt--ddeeffaauullttss

           Print the program name and all options that it gets from option
           files.

       +o   ----pprroottooccooll=={{TTCCPP||SSOOCCKKEETT||PPIIPPEE||MMEEMMOORRYY}}

           The connection protocol to use for connecting to the server. It is
           useful when the other connection parameters normally would cause a
           protocol to be used other than the one you want. For details on the
           permissible values, see Section 4.2.2, "Connecting to the MySQL
           Server".

       +o   ----rreellaattiivvee, --rr

           Show the difference between the current and previous values when
           used with the ----sslleeeepp option. This option works only with the
           extended-status command.

       +o   ----sshhaarreedd--mmeemmoorryy--bbaassee--nnaammee==_n_a_m_e

           On Windows, the shared-memory name to use, for connections made
           using shared memory to a local server. The default value is MYSQL.
           The shared-memory name is case sensitive.

           The server must be started with the ----sshhaarreedd--mmeemmoorryy option to
           enable shared-memory connections.

       +o   ----ssiilleenntt, --ss

           Exit silently if a connection to the server cannot be established.

       +o   ----sslleeeepp==_d_e_l_a_y, --ii _d_e_l_a_y

           Execute commands repeatedly, sleeping for _d_e_l_a_y seconds in between.
           The ----ccoouunntt option determines the number of iterations. If ----ccoouunntt
           is not given, mmyyssqqllaaddmmiinn executes commands indefinitely until
           interrupted.

       +o   ----ssoocckkeett==_p_a_t_h, --SS _p_a_t_h

           For connections to localhost, the Unix socket file to use, or, on
           Windows, the name of the named pipe to use.

       +o   ----ssssll**

           Options that begin with ----ssssll specify whether to connect to the
           server using SSL and indicate where to find SSL keys and
           certificates. See Section 6.3.8.5, "Command Options for Secure
           Connections".

       +o   ----uusseerr==_u_s_e_r___n_a_m_e, --uu _u_s_e_r___n_a_m_e

           The MySQL user name to use when connecting to the server.

       +o   ----vveerrbboossee, --vv

           Verbose mode. Print more information about what the program does.

       +o   ----vveerrssiioonn, --VV

           Display version information and exit.

       +o   ----vveerrttiiccaall, --EE

           Print output vertically. This is similar to ----rreellaattiivvee, but prints
           output vertically.

       +o   ----wwaaiitt[[==_c_o_u_n_t]], --ww[[_c_o_u_n_t]]

           If the connection cannot be established, wait and retry instead of
           aborting. If a _c_o_u_n_t value is given, it indicates the number of
           times to retry. The default is one time.

       You can also set the following variables by using ----_v_a_r___n_a_m_e==_v_a_l_u_e The
       ----sseett--vvaarriiaabbllee format is deprecated and was removed in MySQL 5.5.3.
       syntax:

       +o   connect_timeout

           The maximum number of seconds before connection timeout. The
           default value is 43200 (12 hours).

       +o   shutdown_timeout

           The maximum number of seconds to wait for server shutdown. The
           default value is 3600 (1 hour).
