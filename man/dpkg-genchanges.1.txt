DDEESSCCRRIIPPTTIIOONN
       ddppkkgg--ggeenncchhaannggeess  reads  information  from  an unpacked and built Debian
       source tree and from the files it has generated and generates a  Debian
       upload control file (..cchhaannggeess file).

OOPPTTIIOONNSS
       --bb, --BB, --AA
              Specifies  that  a  binary-only build is taking place (no source
              files are to be included). There's no distinction between --bb, --BB
              and  --AA,  the produced ..cchhaannggeess file will include whatever files
              were created by the bbiinnaarryy--**  target(s)  of  the  package  being
              built.

       --SS     Specifies  that  only  the  source should be uploaded (no binary
              packages will be included).

       The --ss_x options control whether the original source archive is included
       in  the upload if any source is being generated (i.e.  --bb or --BB haven't
       been used).

       --ssii    By default,  or  if  specified,  the  original  source  will  be
              included  only if the upstream version number (the version with-
              out epoch and without Debian revision) differs from the upstream
              version number of the previous changelog entry.

       --ssaa    Forces the inclusion of the original source.

       --ssdd    Forces  the  exclusion  of the original source and includes only
              the diff.

       --vv_v_e_r_s_i_o_n
              Causes changelog information from all  versions  strictly  later
              than _v_e_r_s_i_o_n to be used.

       --CC_c_h_a_n_g_e_s_-_d_e_s_c_r_i_p_t_i_o_n
              Read  the  description  of  the  changes  from the file _c_h_a_n_g_e_s_-
              _d_e_s_c_r_i_p_t_i_o_n rather than using the information  from  the  source
              tree's changelog file.

       --mm_m_a_i_n_t_a_i_n_e_r_-_a_d_d_r_e_s_s
              Use  _m_a_i_n_t_a_i_n_e_r_-_a_d_d_r_e_s_s  as  the  name  and email address of the
              maintainer for this package, rather than using  the  information
              from the source tree's control file.

       --ee_m_a_i_n_t_a_i_n_e_r_-_a_d_d_r_e_s_s
              Use  _m_a_i_n_t_a_i_n_e_r_-_a_d_d_r_e_s_s  as  the  name  and email address of the
              maintainer for this upload, rather than  using  the  information
              from the source tree's changelog.

       --VV_n_a_m_e==_v_a_l_u_e
              Set an output substitution variable.  See ddeebb--ssuubbssttvvaarrss(5) for a
              discussion of output substitution.

       --TT_s_u_b_s_t_v_a_r_s_-_f_i_l_e
              Read substitution variables in _s_u_b_s_t_v_a_r_s_-_f_i_l_e;  the  default  is
              ddeebbiiaann//ssuubbssttvvaarrss.   No  variable  substitution is done on any of
              the fields that are output, however the special variable  _F_o_r_m_a_t
              will  override  the  field  of the same name. This option can be
              used multiple times to read substitution variables from multiple
              files.


       --DD_f_i_e_l_d==_v_a_l_u_e
              Override or add an output control file field.

       --UU_f_i_e_l_d
              Remove an output control file field.

       --cc_c_o_n_t_r_o_l_f_i_l_e
              Specifies the main source control file to read information from.
              The default is ddeebbiiaann//ccoonnttrrooll.

       --ll_c_h_a_n_g_e_l_o_g_-_f_i_l_e
              Specifies the changelog  file  to  read  information  from.  The
              default is ddeebbiiaann//cchhaannggeelloogg.

       --ff_f_i_l_e_s_-_l_i_s_t_-_f_i_l_e
              Read  the  list  of files to be uploaded here, rather than using
              ddeebbiiaann//ffiilleess.

       --FF_c_h_a_n_g_e_l_o_g_-_f_o_r_m_a_t
              Specifies  the  format   of   the   changelog.   See   ddppkkgg--ppaarr--
              sseecchhaannggeelloogg(1) for information about alternative formats.

       --uu_u_p_l_o_a_d_-_f_i_l_e_s_-_d_i_r
              Look  for  the  files  to be uploaded in _u_p_l_o_a_d_-_f_i_l_e_s_-_d_i_r rather
              than ....  (ddppkkgg--ggeenncchhaannggeess needs to find these files so  that  it
              can include their sizes and checksums in the ..cchhaannggeess file).

       --qq     Usually  ddppkkgg--ggeenncchhaannggeess  will  produce  informative messages on
              standard error, for example about  how  many  of  the  package's
              source files are being uploaded.  --qq suppresses these messages.

       --??, ----hheellpp
              Show the usage message and exit.

       ----vveerrssiioonn
              Show the version and exit.

FFIILLEESS
       ddeebbiiaann//ffiilleess
              The  list  of generated files which are part of the upload being
              prepared.  ddppkkgg--ggeenncchhaannggeess reads the data here when producing  a
              ..cchhaannggeess file.
