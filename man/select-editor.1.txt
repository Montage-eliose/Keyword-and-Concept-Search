       sseelleecctt--eeddiittoorr provides a coherent mechanism for selecting and storing a
       preferred  sensible-editor on a per-user basis.  It lists the available
       editors on a system and interactively prompts the user to  select  one.
       The  results are stored as SELECTED_EDITOR in ~/.selected_editor, which
       is sourced and used by sensible-editor.  SELECTED_EDITOR is  overridden
       by the VISUAL and EDITOR environment variables.
