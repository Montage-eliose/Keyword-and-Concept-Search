       mmyyssqqll__zzaapp kills processes that match a pattern. It uses the ppss command
       and Unix signals, so it runs on Unix and Unix-like systems.

       Invoke mmyyssqqll__zzaapp like this:

           shell> mmyyssqqll__zzaapp [[--_s_i_g_n_a_l]] [[--??IIfftt]] _p_a_t_t_e_r_n

       A process matches if its output line from the ppss command contains the
       pattern. By default, mmyyssqqll__zzaapp asks for confirmation for each process.
       Respond y to kill the process, or q to exit mmyyssqqll__zzaapp. For any other
       response, mmyyssqqll__zzaapp does not attempt to kill the process.

       If the --_s_i_g_n_a_l option is given, it specifies the name or number of the
       signal to send to each process. Otherwise, mmyyssqqll__zzaapp tries first with
       TERM (signal 15) and then with KILL (signal 9).

       mmyyssqqll__zzaapp supports the following additional options:

       +o   ----hheellpp, --??, --II

           Display a help message and exit.

       +o   --ff

           Force mode.  mmyyssqqll__zzaapp attempts to kill each process without
           confirmation.

       +o   --tt

           Test mode. Display information about each process but do not kill
           it.
