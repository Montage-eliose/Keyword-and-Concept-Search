       This  manual page explains how you can use the ttzzsseelleecctt utility to view
       the installed timezone. It comes handy when you want to know what  time
       it is in other countries, or if you just wonder what timezones exist.

       ttzzsseelleecctt  is  called  without any parameters from the shell. It shows a
       list of about one dozen geographic areas one can roughly  recognize  as
       continents. After choosing a geographic area by number, a list of coun-
       tries and cities in this area will be shown.

       You can press the EEnntteerr key to reprint the list. To choose a  timezone,
       just  press  the number left to it.  If your input is invalid, the list
       will be reprinted.

       You may press CCttrrll--CC to interrupt the script at any time.

       Note that ttzzsseelleecctt will not actually change the timezone for  you.  Use
       'dpkg-reconfigure tzdata' to achieve this.
