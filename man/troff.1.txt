       This manual page describes the GNU version of ttrrooffff.  It is part of the
       groff document formatting system.  It is functionally  compatible  with
       UNIX  troff,  but  has  many extensions, see ggrrooffff__ddiiffff(7).  Usually it
       should be invoked using the ggrrooffff(1) command which will also  run  pre-
       processors  and  postprocessors  in  the appropriate order and with the
       appropriate options.

OOPPTTIIOONNSS
       It is possible to have whitespace between a command line option and its
       parameter.

       --aa        Generate an ASCII approximation of the typeset output.

       --bb        Print  a  backtrace with each warning or error message.  This
                 backtrace should help track down the cause of the error.  The
                 line  numbers  given  in the backtrace may not always be cor-
                 rect, for ttrrooffff's idea of line numbers gets confused by aass or
                 aamm requests.

       --cc        Disable color output (always disabled in compatibility mode).

       --CC        Enable compatibility mode.

       --dd_c_s
       --dd_n_a_m_e==_s  Define  _c  or  _n_a_m_e  to be a string _s; _c must be a one letter
                 name.

       --EE        Inhibit all error messages of ttrrooffff.  Note that this  doesn't
                 affect  messages  output  to standard error by macro packages
                 using the ttmm or ttmm11 requests.

       --ff_f_a_m     Use _f_a_m as the default font family.

       --FF_d_i_r     Search in directory (or directory path) _d_i_r  for  subdirecto-
                 ries  ddeevv_n_a_m_e  (_n_a_m_e is the name of the device) and there for
                 the DDEESSCC file and font files.   _d_i_r  is  scanned  before  all
                 other font directories.

       --ii        Read  the standard input after all the named input files have
                 been processed.

       --II_d_i_r     This option may be used to add a directory to the search path
                 for  files (both those on the command line and those named in
                 ..ppssbbbb requests).  The search path  is  initialized  with  the
                 current  directory.   This  option may be specified more than
                 once; the directories are then searched in the  order  speci-
                 fied (but before the current directory).  If you want to make
                 the current directory be read before other  directories,  add
                 --II.. at the appropriate place.

                 No  directory  search is performed for files with an absolute
                 file name.

       --mm_n_a_m_e    Read in the file _n_a_m_e..ttmmaacc.  If it isn't found, try ttmmaacc.._n_a_m_e
                 instead.   It will be first searched for in directories given
                 with the --MM command line option, then in directories given in
                 the GGRROOFFFF__TTMMAACC__PPAATTHH environment variable, then in the current
                 directory (only if  in  unsafe  mode),  the  home  directory,
                 /usr/lib/groff/site-tmac,   /usr/share/groff/site-tmac,   and
                 /usr/share/groff/1.22.2/tmac.

       --MM_d_i_r     Search directory (or directory path)  _d_i_r  for  macro  files.
                 This is scanned before all other macro directories.

       --nn_n_u_m     Number the first page _n_u_m.

       --oo_l_i_s_t    Output only pages in _l_i_s_t, which is a comma-separated list of
                 page ranges; _n means print page _n, _m--_n means print every page
                 between  _m and _n, --_n means print every page up to _n, _n-- means
                 print every page from _n.  ttrrooffff will exit after printing  the
                 last page in the list.

       --rr_c_n
       --rr_n_a_m_e==_n  Set number register _c or _n_a_m_e to _n; _c must be a one character
                 name; _n can be any troff numeric expression.

       --RR        Don't load ttrrooffffrrcc and ttrrooffffrrcc--eenndd.

       --TT_n_a_m_e    Prepare output for device _n_a_m_e, rather than the  default  ppss;
                 see ggrrooffff(1) for a more detailed description.

       --UU        Unsafe  mode.  This will enable the following requests: ooppeenn,
                 ooppeennaa, ppssoo, ssyy, and ppii.  For security reasons,  these  poten-
                 tially  dangerous  requests  are disabled otherwise.  It will
                 also add the current directory to the macro search path.

       --vv        Print the version number.

       --ww_n_a_m_e    Enable warning _n_a_m_e.  Available warnings are described in the
                 section _W_A_R_N_I_N_G_S below.  For example, to enable all warnings,
                 use --ww aallll.  Multiple --ww options are allowed.

       --WW_n_a_m_e    Inhibit warning _n_a_m_e.  Multiple --WW options are allowed.

       --zz        Suppress formatted output.

WWAARRNNIINNGGSS
       The warnings that can be given by ttrrooffff are divided into the  following
       categories.   The  name  associated with each warning is used by the --ww
       and --WW options; the number is used by the  wwaarrnn  request,  and  by  the
       ..wwaarrnn register; it is always a power of 2 to allow bitwise composition.

                           no current diversion.

       eell             16   Use of the eell request with no matching iiee request.

                           character is ignored.

                           Enabled by default.

       ffoonntt       131072   Non-existent fonts.  This is enabled by default.

       iigg         262144   Invalid   escapes  in  text  ignored  with  the  iigg
                           request.  These are conditions that are errors when
                           they do not occur in ignored text.

       iinnppuutt       16384   Invalid input characters.

       mmaacc           512   Use  of  undefined  strings, macros and diversions.
                           When an undefined string,  macro  or  diversion  is
                           used,  that  string  is  automatically  defined  as
                           empty.  So, in most cases, at most one warning will
                           be given for each name.

       mmiissssiinngg      8192   Requests that are missing non-optional arguments.

       nnuummbbeerr          2   Invalid  numeric  expressions.   This is enabled by
                           default.

                           fined  number  register  is  used, that register is
                           automatically defined to have a value of 0.  So, in
                           most  cases,  at most one warning will be given for
                           use of a particular name.

       ssppaaccee       65536   Missing space between a request or  macro  and  its
                           argument.  This warning will be given when an unde-
                           fined name longer than two  characters  is  encoun-
                           tered,  and  the  first  two characters of the name
                           make a defined name.  The request or macro will not
                           be  invoked.   When this warning is given, no macro
                           is  automatically  defined.   This  is  enabled  by
                           default.  This warning will never occur in compati-
                           bility mode.

       ssyynnttaaxx        128   Dubious syntax in numeric expressions.

       ttaabb          2048   Inappropriate use of a tab character.   Either  use
                           of  a tab character where a number was expected, or
                           use of tab character in an unquoted macro argument.

       There are also names that can be used to refer to groups of warnings:

       aallll    All warnings except ddii, mmaacc, and rreegg.  It is intended that  this
              covers all warnings that are useful with traditional macro pack-
              ages.

       ww      All warnings.
