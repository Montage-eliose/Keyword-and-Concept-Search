       The ppeerrlliivvpp program is set up at Perl source code build time to test
       the Perl version it was built under.  It can be used after running:

           make install

       (or your platform's equivalent procedure) to verify that ppeerrll and its
       libraries have been installed correctly.  A correct installation is
       verified by output that looks like:

           ok 1
           ok 2

       etc.

       --hh help
            Prints out a brief help message.

       --pp print preface
            Gives a description of each test prior to performing it.

       --vv verbose
            Gives more detailed information about each test, after it has been
            performed.  Note that any failed tests ought to print out some
            extra information whether or not -v is thrown.

       +o   print "# Perl binary '$perlpath' does not appear executable.\n";

           Likely to occur for a perl binary that was not properly installed.
           Correct by conducting a proper installation.

       +o   print "# Perl version '$]' installed, expected $ivp_VERSION.\n";

           Likely to occur for a perl that was not properly installed.
           Correct by conducting a proper installation.

       +o   print "# Perl \@INC directory '$_' does not appear to exist.\n";

           Likely to occur for a perl library tree that was not properly
           installed.  Correct by conducting a proper installation.

       +o   print "# Needed module '$_' does not appear to be properly
           installed.\n";

           One of the two modules that is used by perlivp was not present in
           the installation.  This is a serious error since it adversely
           affects perlivp's ability to function.  You may be able to correct
           this by performing a proper perl installation.

       +o   print "# Required module '$_' does not appear to be properly
           installed.\n";

           An attempt to "eval "require $module"" failed, even though the list
           of extensions indicated that it should succeed.  Correct by
           conducting a proper installation.

       +o   print "# Unnecessary module 'bLuRfle' appears to be installed.\n";

           This test not coming out ok could indicate that you have in fact
           installed a bLuRfle.pm module or that the "eval " require
           \"$module_name.pm\"; "" test may give misleading results with your
           installation of perl.  If yours is the latter case then please let
           the author know.

       +o   print "# file",+($#missing == 0) ? '' : 's'," missing from
           installation:\n";

           One or more files turned up missing according to a run of
           "ExtUtils::Installed -> validate()" over your installation.
           Correct by conducting a proper installation.

       For further information on how to conduct a proper installation consult
       the INSTALL file that comes with the perl source and the README file
       for your platform.
