NNAAMMEE
       join - join lines of two files on a common field

SSYYNNOOPPSSIISS
       jjooiinn [_O_P_T_I_O_N]... _F_I_L_E_1 _F_I_L_E_2

DDEESSCCRRIIPPTTIIOONN
       For  each  pair of input lines with identical join fields, write a line
       to standard output.  The default join field is the first, delimited  by
       whitespace.  When FILE1 or FILE2 (not both) is -, read standard input.

       --aa FILENUM
              also  print unpairable lines from file FILENUM, where FILENUM is
              1 or 2, corresponding to FILE1 or FILE2

       --ee EMPTY
              replace missing input fields with EMPTY

       --ii, ----iiggnnoorree--ccaassee
              ignore differences in case when comparing fields

       --jj FIELD
              equivalent to '-1 FIELD --22 FIELD'

       --oo FORMAT
              obey FORMAT while constructing output line

       --tt CHAR
              use CHAR as input and output field separator

       --vv FILENUM
              like --aa FILENUM, but suppress joined output lines

       --11 FIELD
              join on this FIELD of file 1

       --22 FIELD
              join on this FIELD of file 2

       ----cchheecckk--oorrddeerr
              check that the input is correctly  sorted,  even  if  all  input
              lines are pairable

       ----nnoocchheecckk--oorrddeerr
              do not check that the input is correctly sorted

       ----hheeaaddeerr
              treat  the  first line in each file as field headers, print them
              without trying to pair them

       ----hheellpp display this help and exit

       ----vveerrssiioonn
              output version information and exit

       Unless --tt CHAR  is  given,  leading  blanks  separate  fields  and  are
       ignored,  else fields are separated by CHAR.  Any FIELD is a field num-
       ber counted from 1.  FORMAT is one or more  comma  or  blank  separated
       specifications, each being 'FILENUM.FIELD' or '0'.  Default FORMAT out-
       puts the join field, the remaining fields  from  FILE1,  the  remaining
       fields  from  FILE2,  all  separated by CHAR.  If FORMAT is the keyword
       'auto', then the first line of  each  file  determines  the  number  of
       fields output for each line.

       Important:  FILE1  and  FILE2 must be sorted on the join fields.  E.g.,
       use "sort --kk 1b,1" if 'join' has no options, or use  "join  --tt  ''"  if
       'sort'  has no options.  Note, comparisons honor the rules specified by
       'LC_COLLATE'.  If the input is not sorted  and  some  lines  cannot  be
       joined, a warning message will be given.
