       kkiillllaallll  sends  a  signal to all processes running any of the specified
       commands.  If no signal name is specified, SIGTERM is sent.

       Signals can be specified either by name (e.g.  --HHUUPP or --SSIIGGHHUUPP)  or  by
       number (e.g.  --11) or by option --ss.

       If  the command name is not regular expression (option --rr) and contains
       a slash (//), processes executing that particular file will be  selected
       for killing, independent of their name.

       kkiillllaallll  returns  a  zero  return code if at least one process has been
       killed for each listed command, or no commands were listed and at least
       one  process  matched  the  -u and -Z search criteria.  kkiillllaallll returns
       non-zero otherwise.

       A kkiillllaallll process never kills itself (but may kill other  kkiillllaallll  pro-
       cesses).

OOPPTTIIOONNSS
       --ee, ----eexxaacctt
              Require  an  exact match for very long names.  If a command name
              is longer than 15 characters, the full name may  be  unavailable
              (i.e.   it  is  swapped  out).   In this case, kkiillllaallll will kill
              everything that matches within the first  15  characters.   With
              --ee, such entries are skipped.  kkiillllaallll prints a message for each
              skipped entry if --vv is specified in addition to --ee,

       --II, ----iiggnnoorree--ccaassee
              Do case insensitive process name match.

       --gg, ----pprroocceessss--ggrroouupp
              Kill the process group to which the process belongs.   The  kill
              signal  is  only sent once per group, even if multiple processes
              belonging to the same process group were found.

       --ii, ----iinntteerraaccttiivvee
              Interactively ask for confirmation before killing.

       --ll, ----lliisstt
              List all known signal names.

       --oo, ----oollddeerr--tthhaann
              Match only processes that are older (started  before)  the  time
              specified.   The  time is specified as a float then a unit.  The
              units are  s,m,h,d,w,M,y  for  seconds,  minutes,  hours,  days,
              weeks, Months and years respectively.

       --qq, ----qquuiieett
              Do not complain if no processes were killed.

       --rr, ----rreeggeexxpp
              Interpret  process  name  pattern as an extended regular expres-
              sion.

       --ss, ----ssiiggnnaall
              Send this signal instead of SIGTERM.

       --uu, ----uusseerr
              Kill only processes the specified user owns.  Command names  are
              optional.

       --vv, ----vveerrbboossee
              Report if the signal was successfully sent.

       --VV, ----vveerrssiioonn
              Display version information.

       --ww, ----wwaaiitt
              Wait  for  all killed processes to die.  kkiillllaallll checks once per
              second if any of the  killed  processes  still  exist  and  only
              returns if none are left.  Note that kkiillllaallll may wait forever if
              the signal was ignored, had no effect, or if the  process  stays
              in zombie state.

       --yy, ----yyoouunnggeerr--tthhaann
              Match  only  processes that are younger (started after) the time
              specified.  The time is specified as a float then a  unit.   The
              units  are  s,m,h,d,w,M,y  for  seconds,  minutes,  hours, days,
              weeks, Months and years respectively.

       --ZZ, ----ccoonntteexxtt
              (SELinux Only) Specify security  context:  kill  only  processes
              having  security  context that match with given expended regular
              expression pattern.  Must precede other arguments on the command
              line.  Command names are optional.

       Killing  by  file  only works for executables that are kept open during
       execution, i.e. impure executables can't be killed this way.

       Be warned that typing kkiillllaallll _n_a_m_e may not have the desired  effect  on
       non-Linux systems, especially when done by a privileged user.

       kkiillllaallll  --ww doesn't detect if a process disappears and is replaced by a
       new process with the same PID between scans.

       If processes change their name, kkiillllaallll may not be able to  match  them
       correctly.

       kkiillllaallll has a limit of names that can be specified on the command line.
       This figure is the size of an unsigned long multiplied by 8.  For  most
       32  bit  systems  the limit is 32 and similarly for a 64 bit system the
       limit is usually 64.
