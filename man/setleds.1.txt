       SSeettlleeddss  reports and changes the led flag settings of a VT (namely Num-
       Lock, CapsLock and ScrollLock).  Without arguments, sseettlleeddss prints  the
       current  settings.   With  arguments,  it  sets or clears the indicated
       flags (and leaves the others unchanged).  The settings before and after
       the change are reported if the -v flag is given.

       The  led flag settings are specific for each VT (and the VT correspond-
       ing to stdin is used).

       By default (or with option -F), sseettlleeddss will only change the  VT  flags
       (and their setting may be reflected by the keyboard leds).

       With option -D, sseettlleeddss will change both the VT flags and their default
       settings (so that a subsequent reset will not undo the  change).   This
       might be useful for people who always want to have numlock set.

       With  option  -L,  sseettlleeddss will not touch the VT flags, but only change
       the leds.  From this moment on, the leds will no longer reflect the  VT
       flags  (but display whatever is put into them).  The command sseettlleeddss --LL
       (without further arguments) will restore the  situation  in  which  the
       leds reflect the VT flags.

       One  might  use  sseettlleeddss  in  /etc/rc to define the initial and default
       state of NumLock, e.g. by
            INITTY=/dev/tty[1-8]
            for tty in $INITTY; do
                 setleds -D +num < $tty
            done

OOPPTTIIOONNSS
       -num +num
              Clear or set NumLock.  (At present, the NumLock  setting  influ-
              ences  the  interpretation of keypad keys.  Pressing the NumLock
              key complements the NumLock setting.)

       -caps +caps
              Clear or set CapsLock.  (At present, the CapsLock  setting  com-
              plements  the  Shift  key when applied to letters.  Pressing the
              CapsLock key complements the CapsLock setting.)

       -scroll +scroll
              Clear or set ScrollLock.  (At present, pressing  the  ScrollLock
              key (or ^S/^Q) stops/starts console output.)

BBUUGGSS
       In  keyboard  application  mode  the NumLock key does not influence the
       NumLock flag setting.
