       tailf - follow the growth of a log file

       ttaaiillff  will print out the last 10 lines of a file and then wait for the
       file to grow.  It is similar to ttaaiill --ff but does not  access  the  file
       when  it  is not growing.  This has the side effect of not updating the
       access time for the file, so a filesystem flush does not occur periodi-
       cally when no log activity is happening.

       ttaaiillff  is  extremely  useful  for monitoring log files on a laptop when
       logging is infrequent and the user desires that the hard disk spin down
       to conserve battery life.

       Mandatory  arguments  to  long  options are mandatory for short options
       too.

       --nn, ----lliinneess=_N, --NN
              output the last _N lines, instead of the last 10.

       --VV, ----vveerrssiioonn
              Output version information and exit.

       --hh, ----hheellpp
              Display help and exit.
