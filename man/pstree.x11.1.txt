       ppssttrreeee shows running processes as a tree.  The tree is rooted at either
       _p_i_d or iinniitt if _p_i_d is omitted.   If  a  user  name  is  specified,  all
       process trees rooted at processes owned by that user are shown.

       ppssttrreeee  visually  merges  identical  branches by putting them in square
       brackets and prefixing them with the repetition count, e.g.

           init-+-getty
                |-getty
                |-getty
                `-getty

       becomes

           init---4*[getty]


       Child threads of a process are found under the parent process  and  are
       shown with the process name in curly braces, e.g.

           icecast2---13*[{icecast2}]


       If  ppssttrreeee  is called as ppssttrreeee..xx1111 then it will prompt the user at the
       end of the line to press return and will not return until that has hap-
       pened.  This is useful for when ppssttrreeee is run in a xterminal.

       Certain  kernel  or  mount  parameters,  such as the hidepid option for
       procfs, will hide information for some processes. In  these  situations
       ppssttrreeee will attempt to build the tree without this information, showing
       process names as question marks.


OOPPTTIIOONNSS
       --aa     Show command line arguments.  If the command line of  a  process
              is  swapped  out,  that  process  is  shown  in parentheses.  --aa
              implicitly disables compaction for processes but not threads.

       --AA     Use ASCII characters to draw the tree.

       --cc     Disable compaction of identical subtrees.  By default,  subtrees
              are compacted whenever possible.

       --GG     Use VT100 line drawing characters.

       --hh     Highlight  the current process and its ancestors.  This is a no-
              op if the terminal doesn't support highlighting  or  if  neither
              the  current process nor any of its ancestors are in the subtree
              being shown.

       --HH     Like --hh, but highlight the specified  process  instead.   Unlike
              with  --hh,  ppssttrreeee  fails  when  using  --HH if highlighting is not
              available.

       --gg     Show PGIDs.  Process Group IDs are shown as decimal  numbers  in
              parentheses  after  each  process  name.  --pp implicitly disables
              compaction.  If both PIDs and PGIDs are displayed then PIDs  are
              shown first.

       --ll     Display long lines.  By default, lines are truncated to the dis-
              play width or 132 if output is sent to a non-tty or if the  dis-
              play width is unknown.

       --nn     Sort processes with the same ancestor by PID instead of by name.
              (Numeric sort.)

       --pp     Show PIDs.  PIDs are shown as  decimal  numbers  in  parentheses
              after each process name.  --pp implicitly disables compaction.

       --ss     Show parent processes of the specified process.

       --uu     Show  uid  transitions.   Whenever  the uid of a process differs
              from the uid of its parent, the new uid is shown in  parentheses
              after the process name.

       --UU     Use UTF-8 (Unicode) line drawing characters.  Under Linux 1.1-54
              and above, UTF-8 mode is entered on the  console  with  eecchhoo  --ee
              '' 3333%%88'' and left with eecchhoo --ee '' 3333%%@@''

       --VV     Display version information.

       --ZZ     (SELinux)  Show  security  context  for each process.  This flag
              will only work if pstree is compilied with SELinux support.

FFIILLEESS
       /proc  location of the proc file system

BBUUGGSS
       Some character sets may be incompatible with the VT100 characters.

SSEEEE AALLSSOO
       ppss(1), ttoopp(1).
