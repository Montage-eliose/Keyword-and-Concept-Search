       _r_e_p_o_r_t_-_h_w  outputs  a summary of the system's hardware to standard out-
       put. This hardware summary is aimed at diagnosing problems  with  hard-
       ware  autodetection, or other problems during a Debian install, but can
       also be useful to run on an installed system.
