       ssllaabbttoopp  displays  detailed kernel slab cache information in real time.
       It displays a listing of the top caches sorted by  one  of  the  listed
       sort  criteria.   It also displays a statistics header filled with slab
       layer information.

       Normal invocation of ssllaabbttoopp does not require any options.  The  behav-
       ior,  however,  can be fine-tuned by specifying one or more of the fol-
       lowing flags:

       --dd, ----ddeellaayy=_N
              Refresh the display every _n in  seconds.   By  default,  ssllaabbttoopp
              refreshes the display every three seconds.  To exit the program,
              hit qq..

       --ss, ----ssoorrtt=_S
              Sort by _S, where _S is one of the sort criteria.

       --oo, ----oonnccee
              Display the output once and then exit.

       --VV, ----vveerrssiioonn
              Display version information and exit.

       --hh, ----hheellpp
              Display usage information and exit.

       The following are valid sort criteria used to sort the individual  slab
       caches and thereby determine what are the "top" slab caches to display.
       The default sort criteria is to sort by the number of objects ("o").

       The sort criteria can also be  changed  while  slabtop  is  running  by
       pressing the associated character.

       ssllaabbttoopp accepts keyboard commands from the user during use.   The  fol-
       lowing are supported.  In the case of letters, both cases are accepted.

       Each of the valid sort characters are also accepted, to change the sort
       routine. See the section SSOORRTT CCRRIITTEERRIIAA.

NNOOTTEESS
       Currently, ssllaabbttoopp requires a 2.4 or later kernel (specifically, a ver-
       sion  1.1  or later _/_p_r_o_c_/_s_l_a_b_i_n_f_o).  Kernel 2.2 should be supported in
       the future.

       The slabtop statistic header is tracking how many bytes  of  slabs  are
       being  used  and it not a measure of physical memory.  The 'Slab' field
       in the /proc/meminfo file is tracking information about used slab phys-
       ical memory.
