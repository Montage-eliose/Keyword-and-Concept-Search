       _i_p_c_r_m  removes  System  V  interprocess communication (IPC) objects and
       associated data structures from the system.  In order  to  delete  such
       objects, you must be superuser, or the creator or owner of the object.

       System V IPC objects are of three types: shared memory, message queues,
       and semaphores.  Deletion of a message queue  or  semaphore  object  is
       immediate (regardless of whether any process still holds an IPC identi-
       fier for the object).  A shared memory object is only removed after all
       currently  attached  processes have detached (sshhmmddtt(2)) the object from
       their virtual address space.

       Two syntax styles are supported.  The old Linux historical syntax spec-
       ifies  a three letter keyword indicating which class of object is to be
       deleted, followed by one or more IPC identifiers for  objects  of  this
       type.

       The  SUS-compliant  syntax  allows  the  specification  of zero or more
       objects of all three types in a single command line, with objects spec-
       ified either by key or by identifier. (See below.)  Both keys and iden-
       tifiers may be specified in decimal,  hexadecimal  (specified  with  an
       initial '0x' or '0X'), or octal (specified with an initial '0').

       --MM _s_h_m_k_e_y
              removes  the shared memory segment created with _s_h_m_k_e_y after the
              last detach is performed.

       --mm _s_h_m_i_d
              removes the shared memory segment identified by _s_h_m_i_d after  the
              last detach is performed.

       --QQ _m_s_g_k_e_y
              removes the message queue created with _m_s_g_k_e_y.

       --qq _m_s_g_i_d
              removes the message queue identified by _m_s_g_i_d.

       --SS _s_e_m_k_e_y
              removes the semaphore created with _s_e_m_k_e_y.

       --ss _s_e_m_i_d
              removes the semaphore identified by _s_e_m_i_d.

       The  details  of the removes are described in _m_s_g_c_t_l(2), _s_h_m_c_t_l(2), and
       _s_e_m_c_t_l(2).  The identifiers and keys may be found by using _i_p_c_s(1).

       In its first Linux implementation, ipcrm  used  the  deprecated  syntax
       shown in the SSYYNNOOPPSSIISS.  Functionality present in other *nix implementa-
       tions of ipcrm has since been  added,  namely  the  ability  to  delete
       resources  by  key  (not just identifier), and to respect the same com-
       mand-line syntax. For backward compatibility  the  previous  syntax  is
       still supported.
