       This  program  will use the 3 provided versions of the Debian changelog
       to generate a merged changelog file. The resulting changelog is  stored
       in  the  file _o_u_t or output to the standard output if that parameter is
       not given.

       Each entry is identified by its version number and they are assumed  to
       be  not  conflicting,  they  are  simply  merged in the right order (by
       decreasing version number). When ----mmeerrggee--pprreerreelleeaasseess is used, the  part
       of  the  version  number  after  the  last  tilde  is  dropped  so that
       1.0-1~exp1 and 1.0-1~exp5 are considered to be the same entry. When the
       same  version  is  available  in both _n_e_w_-_a and _n_e_w_-_b, a standard line-
       based  3-way  merge  is  attempted  (provided  that  the  module  Algo-
       rithm::Merge  is  available  --  it's  part  of  the  package  libalgo-
       rithm-merge-perl -- otherwise you get a global conflict on the  content
       of the entry).

              Drop  the  part  after the last tilde in the version number when
              doing version comparison to identify if two entries are supposed
              to be the same or not.

              This  is useful when you keep using the same changelog entry but
              you increase its version number  regularly.  For  instance,  you
              might  have  2.3-1~exp1,  2.3-1~exp2,  ...  until  the  official
              release 2.3-1 and they are all the same changelog entry that has
              evolved over time.

       ----hheellpp Show the usage message and exit.

       ----vveerrssiioonn
              Show the version and exit.

       Anything  that  is  not  parsed  by  Dpkg::Changelog is lost during the
       merge.  This might include stuff like  vim  modelines,  comments  which
       were not supposed to be there, etc.

       If  you  want  to use this program to merge Debian changelog files in a
       git repository, you have first  to  register  a  new  merge  driver  in
       ..ggiitt//ccoonnffiigg or ~~//..ggiittccoonnffiigg:

        [merge "dpkg-mergechangelogs"]
            name = debian/changelog merge driver
            driver = dpkg-mergechangelogs -m %O %A %B %A

       Then  you  have  to  setup the merge attribute for the debian/changelog
       file  either  in  ..ggiittaattttrriibbuutteess  in  the  repository  itself,  or   in
       ..ggiitt//iinnffoo//aattttrriibbuutteess:

        debian/changelog merge=dpkg-mergechangelogs
