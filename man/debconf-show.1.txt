       ddeebbccoonnff--sshhooww lets you query the debconf database in different ways.

       The most common use is "debconf-show packagename", which displays all
       items in the debconf database owned by a given package, and their
       current values.  Questions that have been asked already are prefixed
       with an '*'.

       This can be useful as a debugging aid, and especially handy in bug
       reports involving a package's use of debconf.

       ----ddbb==_d_b_n_a_m_e
           Specify the database to query. By default, debconf-show queries the
           main database.

       ----lliissttoowwnneerrss
           Lists all owners of questions in the database. Generally an owner
           is equivalent to a debian package name.

       ----lliissttddbbss
           Lists all available databases.
