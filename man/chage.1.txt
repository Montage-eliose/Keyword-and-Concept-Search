       The cchhaaggee command changes the number of days between password changes
       and the date of the last password change. This information is used by
       the system to determine when a user must change his/her password.

OOPPTTIIOONNSS
       The options which apply to the cchhaaggee command are:

       --dd, ----llaassttddaayy _L_A_S_T___D_A_Y
           Set the number of days since January 1st, 1970 when the password
           was last changed. The date may also be expressed in the format
           YYYY-MM-DD (or the format more commonly used in your area).

       --EE, ----eexxppiirreeddaattee _E_X_P_I_R_E___D_A_T_E
           Set the date or number of days since January 1, 1970 on which the
           user's account will no longer be accessible. The date may also be
           expressed in the format YYYY-MM-DD (or the format more commonly
           used in your area). A user whose account is locked must contact the
           system administrator before being able to use the system again.

           Passing the number _-_1 as the _E_X_P_I_R_E___D_A_T_E will remove an account
           expiration date.

       --hh, ----hheellpp
           Display help message and exit.

       --II, ----iinnaaccttiivvee _I_N_A_C_T_I_V_E
           Set the number of days of inactivity after a password has expired
           before the account is locked. The _I_N_A_C_T_I_V_E option is the number of
           days of inactivity. A user whose account is locked must contact the
           system administrator before being able to use the system again.

           Passing the number _-_1 as the _I_N_A_C_T_I_V_E will remove an account's
           inactivity.

       --ll, ----lliisstt
           Show account aging information.

       --mm, ----mmiinnddaayyss _M_I_N___D_A_Y_S
           Set the minimum number of days between password changes to
           _M_I_N___D_A_Y_S. A value of zero for this field indicates that the user
           may change his/her password at any time.

       --MM, ----mmaaxxddaayyss _M_A_X___D_A_Y_S
           Set the maximum number of days during which a password is valid.
           When _M_A_X___D_A_Y_S plus _L_A_S_T___D_A_Y is less than the current day, the user
           will be required to change his/her password before being able to
           use his/her account. This occurrence can be planned for in advance
           by use of the --WW option, which provides the user with advance
           warning.

           Passing the number _-_1 as _M_A_X___D_A_Y_S will remove checking a password's
           validity.

       --RR, ----rroooott _C_H_R_O_O_T___D_I_R
           Apply changes in the _C_H_R_O_O_T___D_I_R directory and use the configuration
           files from the _C_H_R_O_O_T___D_I_R directory.

       --WW, ----wwaarrnnddaayyss _W_A_R_N___D_A_Y_S
           Set the number of days of warning before a password change is
           required. The _W_A_R_N___D_A_Y_S option is the number of days prior to the
           password expiring that a user will be warned his/her password is
           about to expire.

       If none of the options are selected, cchhaaggee operates in an interactive
       fashion, prompting the user with the current values for all of the
       fields. Enter the new value to change the field, or leave the line
       blank to use the current value. The current value is displayed between
       a pair of _[ _] marks.

NNOOTTEE
       The cchhaaggee program requires a shadow password file to be available.

       The cchhaaggee command is restricted to the root user, except for the --ll
       option, which may be used by an unprivileged user to determine when
       his/her password or account is due to expire.
