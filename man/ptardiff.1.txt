       ptardiff - program that diffs an extracted archive against an
       unextracted one

DDEESSCCRRIIPPTTIIOONN
           ptardiff is a small program that diffs an extracted archive
           against an unextracted one, using the perl module Archive::Tar.

           This effectively lets you view changes made to an archives contents.

           Provide the progam with an ARCHIVE_FILE and it will look up all
           the files with in the archive, scan the current working directory
           for a file with the name and diff it against the contents of the
           archive.
