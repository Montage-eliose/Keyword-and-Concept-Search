       mmyyssqqlldd__ssaaffee is the recommended way to start a mmyyssqqlldd server on Unix.
       mmyyssqqlldd__ssaaffee adds some safety features such as restarting the server
       when an error occurs and logging runtime information to an error log
       file. A description of error logging is given later in this section.

       mmyyssqqlldd__ssaaffee tries to start an executable named mmyyssqqlldd. To override the
       default behavior and specify explicitly the name of the server you want
       to run, specify a ----mmyyssqqlldd or ----mmyyssqqlldd--vveerrssiioonn option to mmyyssqqlldd__ssaaffee.
       You can also use ----lleeddiirr to indicate the directory where mmyyssqqlldd__ssaaffee
       should look for the server.

       Many of the options to mmyyssqqlldd__ssaaffee are the same as the options to
       mmyyssqqlldd. See Section 5.1.3, "Server Command Options".

       Options unknown to mmyyssqqlldd__ssaaffee are passed to mmyyssqqlldd if they are
       specified on the command line, but ignored if they are specified in the
       [mysqld_safe] group of an option file. See Section 4.2.6, "Using Option
       Files".

       mmyyssqqlldd__ssaaffee reads all options from the [mysqld], [server], and
       [mysqld_safe] sections in option files. For example, if you specify a
       [mysqld] section like this, mmyyssqqlldd__ssaaffee will find and use the
       ----lloogg--eerrrroorr option:

           [mysqld]
           log-error=error.log

       For backward compatibility, mmyyssqqlldd__ssaaffee also reads [safe_mysqld]
       sections, but to be current you should rename such sections to
       [mysqld_safe].

       mmyyssqqlldd__ssaaffee supports the following options. It also reads option files
       and supports the options for processing them described at
       Section 4.2.7, "Command-Line Options that Affect Option-File Handling".

       +o   ----hheellpp

           Display a help message and exit.

       +o   ----bbaasseeddiirr==_d_i_r___n_a_m_e

           The path to the MySQL installation directory.

       +o   ----ccoorree--ffiillee--ssiizzee==_s_i_z_e

           The size of the core file that mmyyssqqlldd should be able to create. The
           option value is passed to uulliimmiitt --cc.

       +o   ----ddaattaaddiirr==_d_i_r___n_a_m_e

           The path to the data directory.

       +o   ----ddeeffaauullttss--eexxttrraa--ffiillee==_f_i_l_e___n_a_m_e

           The name of an option file to be read in addition to the usual
           option files. This must be the first option on the command line if
           it is used. If the file does not exist or is otherwise
           inaccessible, the server will exit with an error.

       +o   ----ddeeffaauullttss--ffiillee==_f_i_l_e___n_a_m_e

           The name of an option file to be read instead of the usual option
           files. This must be the first option on the command line if it is
           used.

       +o   ----lleeddiirr==_d_i_r___n_a_m_e

           If mmyyssqqlldd__ssaaffee cannot find the server, use this option to indicate
           the path name to the directory where the server is located.

       +o   ----lloogg--eerrrroorr==_f_i_l_e___n_a_m_e

           Write the error log to the given file. See Section 5.2.2, "The
           Error Log".

       +o   ----mmaalllloocc--lliibb==[[_l_i_b___n_a_m_e]] The name of the library to use for memory
           allocation instead of the system malloc() library. Any library can
           be used by specifying its path name, but there is a shortcut form
           to enable use of the tcmalloc library that is shipped with binary
           MySQL distributions for Linux in MySQL 5.5. It is possible that the
           shortcut form will not work under certain configurations, in which
           case you should specify a path name instead.

           The ----mmaalllloocc--lliibb option works by modifying the LD_PRELOAD
           environment value to affect dynamic linking to enable the loader to
           find the memory-allocation library when mmyyssqqlldd runs:

           +o   If the option is not given, or is given without a value
               (----mmaalllloocc--lliibb==), LD_PRELOAD is not modified and no attempt is
               made to use tcmalloc.

           +o   If the option is given as ----mmaalllloocc--lliibb==ttccmmaalllloocc, mmyyssqqlldd__ssaaffee
               looks for a tcmalloc library in /usr/lib and then in the MySQL
               pkglibdir location (for example, /usr/local/mysql/lib or
               whatever is appropriate). If tmalloc is found, its path name is
               added to the beginning of the LD_PRELOAD value for mmyyssqqlldd. If
               tcmalloc is not found, mmyyssqqlldd__ssaaffee aborts with an error.

           +o   If the option is given as ----mmaalllloocc--lliibb==_/_p_a_t_h_/_t_o_/_s_o_m_e_/_l_i_b_r_a_r_y,
               that full path is added to the beginning of the LD_PRELOAD
               value. If the full path points to a nonexistent or unreadable
               file, mmyyssqqlldd__ssaaffee aborts with an error.

           +o   For cases where mmyyssqqlldd__ssaaffee adds a path name to LD_PRELOAD, it
               adds the path to the beginning of any existing value the
               variable already has.

           Linux users can use the libtcmalloc_minimal.so included in binary
           packages by adding these lines to the my.cnf file:

               [mysqld_safe]
               malloc-lib=tcmalloc

           Those lines also suffice for users on any platform who have
           installed a tcmalloc package in /usr/lib. To use a specific
           tcmalloc library, specify its full path name. Example:

               [mysqld_safe]
               malloc-lib=/opt/lib/libtcmalloc_minimal.so

       +o   ----mmyyssqqlldd==_p_r_o_g___n_a_m_e

           The name of the server program (in the ledir directory) that you
           want to start. This option is needed if you use the MySQL binary
           distribution but have the data directory outside of the binary
           distribution. If mmyyssqqlldd__ssaaffee cannot find the server, use the
           ----lleeddiirr option to indicate the path name to the directory where the
           server is located.

       +o   ----mmyyssqqlldd--vveerrssiioonn==_s_u_f_f_i_x

           This option is similar to the ----mmyyssqqlldd option, but you specify only
           the suffix for the server program name. The base name is assumed to
           be mmyyssqqlldd. For example, if you use ----mmyyssqqlldd--vveerrssiioonn==ddeebbuugg,
           mmyyssqqlldd__ssaaffee starts the mmyyssqqlldd--ddeebbuugg program in the ledir directory.
           If the argument to ----mmyyssqqlldd--vveerrssiioonn is empty, mmyyssqqlldd__ssaaffee uses
           mmyyssqqlldd in the ledir directory.

       +o   ----nniiccee==_p_r_i_o_r_i_t_y

           Use the nice program to set the server's scheduling priority to the
           given value.

       +o   ----nnoo--ddeeffaauullttss

           Do not read any option files. This must be the first option on the
           command line if it is used.

       +o   ----ooppeenn--ffiilleess--lliimmiitt==_c_o_u_n_t

           The number of files that mmyyssqqlldd should be able to open. The option
           value is passed to uulliimmiitt --nn.

               NNoottee
               You must start mmyyssqqlldd__ssaaffee as root for this to function
               properly.

       +o   ----ppiidd--ffiillee==_f_i_l_e___n_a_m_e

           The path name of the process ID file.

       +o   ----pplluuggiinn--ddiirr==_d_i_r___n_a_m_e

           The path name of the plugin directory. This option was added in
           MySQL 5.5.3.

       +o   ----ppoorrtt==_p_o_r_t___n_u_m

           The port number that the server should use when listening for
           TCP/IP connections. The port number must be 1024 or higher unless
           the server is started by the root system user.

       +o   ----sskkiipp--kkiillll--mmyyssqqlldd

           Do not try to kill stray mmyyssqqlldd processes at startup. This option
           works only on Linux.

       +o   ----ssoocckkeett==_p_a_t_h

           The Unix socket file that the server should use when listening for
           local connections.

       +o   ----ssyysslloogg, ----sskkiipp--ssyysslloogg

           ----ssyysslloogg causes error messages to be sent to syslog on systems that
           support the llooggggeerr program.  --skip-syslog suppresses the use of
           syslog; messages are written to an error log file.

           When syslog is used, the daemon.err syslog facility/severity is
           used for all log messages.

       +o   ----ssyysslloogg--ttaagg==_t_a_g

           For logging to syslog, messages from mmyyssqqlldd__ssaaffee and mmyyssqqlldd are
           written with identifiers of mysqld_safe and mysqld, respectively.
           To specify a suffix for the identifiers, use ----ssyysslloogg--ttaagg==_t_a_g,
           which modifies the identifiers to be mysqld_safe-_t_a_g and
           mysqld-_t_a_g.

       +o   ----ttiimmeezzoonnee==_t_i_m_e_z_o_n_e

           Set the TZ time zone environment variable to the given option
           value. Consult your operating system documentation for legal time
           zone specification formats.

       +o   ----uusseerr=={{_u_s_e_r___n_a_m_e||_u_s_e_r___i_d}}

           Run the mmyyssqqlldd server as the user having the name _u_s_e_r___n_a_m_e or the
           numeric user ID _u_s_e_r___i_d. ("User" in this context refers to a system
           login account, not a MySQL user listed in the grant tables.)

       If you execute mmyyssqqlldd__ssaaffee with the ----ddeeffaauullttss--ffiillee or
       ----ddeeffaauullttss--eexxttrraa--ffiillee option to name an option file, the option must be
       the first one given on the command line or the option file will not be
       used. For example, this command will not use the named option file:

           mysql> mmyyssqqlldd__ssaaffee ----ppoorrtt==_p_o_r_t___n_u_m ----ddeeffaauullttss--ffiillee==_f_i_l_e___n_a_m_e

       Instead, use the following command:

           mysql> mmyyssqqlldd__ssaaffee ----ddeeffaauullttss--ffiillee==_f_i_l_e___n_a_m_e ----ppoorrtt==_p_o_r_t___n_u_m

       The mmyyssqqlldd__ssaaffee script is written so that it normally can start a
       server that was installed from either a source or a binary distribution
       of MySQL, even though these types of distributions typically install
       the server in slightly different locations. (See Section 2.1.4,
       "Installation Layouts".)  mmyyssqqlldd__ssaaffee expects one of the following
       conditions to be true:

       +o   The server and databases can be found relative to the working
           directory (the directory from which mmyyssqqlldd__ssaaffee is invoked). For
           binary distributions, mmyyssqqlldd__ssaaffee looks under its working directory
           for bin and data directories. For source distributions, it looks
           for libexec and var directories. This condition should be met if
           you execute mmyyssqqlldd__ssaaffee from your MySQL installation directory (for
           example, /usr/local/mysql for a binary distribution).

       +o   If the server and databases cannot be found relative to the working
           directory, mmyyssqqlldd__ssaaffee attempts to locate them by absolute path
           names. Typical locations are /usr/local/libexec and /usr/local/var.
           The actual locations are determined from the values configured into
           the distribution at the time it was built. They should be correct
           if MySQL is installed in the location specified at configuration
           time.

       Because mmyyssqqlldd__ssaaffee tries to find the server and databases relative to
       its own working directory, you can install a binary distribution of
       MySQL anywhere, as long as you run mmyyssqqlldd__ssaaffee from the MySQL
       installation directory:

           shell> ccdd _m_y_s_q_l___i_n_s_t_a_l_l_a_t_i_o_n___d_i_r_e_c_t_o_r_y
           shell> bbiinn//mmyyssqqlldd__ssaaffee &&

       If mmyyssqqlldd__ssaaffee fails, even when invoked from the MySQL installation
       directory, specify the ----lleeddiirr and ----ddaattaaddiirr options to indicate the
       directories in which the server and databases are located on your
       system.

       Beginning with MySQL 5.5.21, mmyyssqqlldd__ssaaffee tries to use the sslleeeepp and
       ddaattee system utilities to determine how many times it has attempted to
       start this second, and--if these are present and this is greater than 5
       times--is forced to wait 1 full second before starting again. This is
       intended to prevent excessive CPU usage in the event of repeated
       failures. (Bug #11761530, Bug #54035)

       When you use mmyyssqqlldd__ssaaffee to start mmyyssqqlldd, mmyyssqqlldd__ssaaffee arranges for
       error (and notice) messages from itself and from mmyyssqqlldd to go to the
       same destination.

       There are several mmyyssqqlldd__ssaaffee options for controlling the destination
       of these messages:

       +o   ----lloogg--eerrrroorr==_f_i_l_e___n_a_m_e: Write error messages to the named error
           file.

       +o   ----ssyysslloogg: Write error messages to syslog on systems that support
           the llooggggeerr program.

       +o   ----sskkiipp--ssyysslloogg: Do not write error messages to syslog. Messages are
           written to the default error log file (_h_o_s_t___n_a_m_e.err in the data
           directory), or to a named file if the ----lloogg--eerrrroorr option is given.

       If none of these options is given, the default is ----sskkiipp--ssyysslloogg.

       If ----lloogg--eerrrroorr and ----ssyysslloogg are both given, a warning is issued and
       ----lloogg--eerrrroorr takes precedence.

       When mmyyssqqlldd__ssaaffee writes a message, notices go to the logging
       destination (syslog or the error log file) and stdout. Errors go to the
       logging destination and stderr.

       Normally, you should not edit the mmyyssqqlldd__ssaaffee script. Instead,
       configure mmyyssqqlldd__ssaaffee by using command-line options or options in the
       [mysqld_safe] section of a my.cnf option file. In rare cases, it might
       be necessary to edit mmyyssqqlldd__ssaaffee to get it to start the server
       properly. However, if you do this, your modified version of mmyyssqqlldd__ssaaffee
       might be overwritten if you upgrade MySQL in the future, so you should
       make a copy of your edited version that you can reinstall.
