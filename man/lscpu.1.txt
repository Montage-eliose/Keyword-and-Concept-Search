       llssccppuu  gathers  CPU  architecture  information  like  number  of  CPUs,
       threads, cores, sockets, NUMA nodes, information about CPU caches,  CPU
       family,  model,  bogoMIPS,  byte  order  and  stepping  from  sysfs and
       /proc/cpuinfo, and prints it in a human-readable format.   It  supports
       both online and offline CPUs.  It can also print out in a parsable for-
       mat, including how different caches are shared by different CPUs, which
       can be fed to other programs.

       --hh, ----hheellpp
              Print a help message.

       --pp, ----ppaarrssee _[_=_l_i_s_t_]
              Print out in parsable instead of human-readable format.

              If  the  _l_i_s_t  argument is not given then the default backwardly
              compatible output is printed.  The backwardly compatible  format
              uses  two commas to separate CPU cache columns. If no CPU caches
              are identified, then the cache columns are not printed at all.

              The _l_i_s_t argument is comma delimited list of the  columns.  Cur-
              rently  supported  are  CPU,  Core, Node, Socket, Book and Cache
              columns. If the _l_i_s_t argument is given then always all requested
              columns  are printed in the defined order. The Cache columns are
              separated by ':'.

              Note that the optional _l_i_s_t argument cannot  be  separated  from
              the  option  by  a  space,  the  correct  form  is  for  example
              '--pp==ccppuu,,nnooddee' or '----ppaarrssee==ccppuu,,nnooddee'.

       --ss, ----ssyyssrroooott _d_i_r_e_c_t_o_r_y
              Use the specified _d_i_r_e_c_t_o_r_y as system root.  This allows you  to
              inspect a snapshot from a different system.

       --xx, ----hheexx
              Use  hexadecimal  masks for CPU sets (e.g. 0x3).  The default is
              to print the sets in list format (e.g. 0,1).

BBUUGGSS
       The basic overview about CPU family, model, etc. is always based on the
       first CPU only.

       Sometimes in Xen Dom0 the kernel reports wrong data.
