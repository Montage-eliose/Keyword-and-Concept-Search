     llooookk [--bbddff] [--tt _t_e_r_m_c_h_a_r] _s_t_r_i_n_g [_f_i_l_e _._._.]

     The llooookk utility displays any lines in _f_i_l_e which contain _s_t_r_i_n_g as a
     prefix.

     If _f_i_l_e is not specified, the file _/_u_s_r_/_s_h_a_r_e_/_d_i_c_t_/_w_o_r_d_s is used, only
     alphanumeric characters are compared and the case of alphabetic charac-
     ters is ignored.

     The following options are available:

     --bb      Use a binary search on the given word list. If you are ignoring
             case with --ff or ignoring non-alphanumeric characters with --dd, the
             file must be sorted in the same way. Please note that these
             options are the default if no filename is given. See sort(1) for
             more information on sorting files.

     --dd      Dictionary character set and order, i.e., only alphanumeric char-
             acters are compared.

     --ff      Ignore the case of alphabetic characters.

     --tt      Specify a string termination character, i.e., only the characters
             in _s_t_r_i_n_g up to and including the first occurrence of _t_e_r_m_c_h_a_r
             are compared.

     The LANG, LC_ALL and LC_CTYPE environment variables affect the execution
     of the llooookk utility.  Their effect is described in environ(7).

     The llooookk utility exits 0 if one or more lines were found and displayed, 1
     if no lines were found, and >1 if an error occurred.

     The original manual page stated that tabs and blank characters partici-
     pated in comparisons when the --dd option was specified.  This was incor-
     rect and the current man page matches the historic implementation.

     llooookk uses a linear search by default instead of a binary search, which is
     what most other implementations use by default.

     A llooookk utility appeared in Version 7 AT&T UNIX.

BBUUGGSS
     Lines are not compared according to the current locale's collating order.
     Input files must be sorted with LC_COLLATE set to 'C'.
