       bbyyoobbuu--sseelleecctt--sseessssiioonn  is an application that lists the available screen
       sessions running on the system, and prompts the  user  to  select  one.
       The  user  also has the option to create a new Byobu session, or launch
       the default shell without Byobu.

       If an invalid selection is chosen 3 times in a row, the  user  is  con-
       nected to the youngest session.

       By  default,  if only one session exists, the user is connected to that
       session, and if no sessions exist, a new session  is  created  --  such
       that  there  is no interactive prompt in the normal behavior.  However,
       some users may choose to always  be  prompted,  by  touching  the  file
       $BYOBU_CONFIG_DIR/.always-select.

       Note that BYOBU_CONFIG_DIR=$HOME/.byobu.

       Named   sessions   that   begin   with   a   "."   are   "hidden"  from
       bbyyoobbuu--sseelleecctt--sseessssiioonn(1).  This is useful, for instance, if you  do  not
       want a session to be automatically selected at login.  Example:
         byobu -S .hidden
