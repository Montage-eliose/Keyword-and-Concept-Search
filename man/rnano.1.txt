       This manual page briefly documents the rrnnaannoo command.

       nnaannoo is a small, free and friendly editor which aims to  replace  Pico,
       the  default  editor included in the non-free Pine package. Rather than
       just copying Pico's look and feel, nnaannoo also  implements  some  missing
       (or disabled by default) features in Pico, such as "search and replace"
       and "go to line and column number".

       rrnnaannoo is a restricted version of nnaannoo, which only edits specific  files
       and doesn't allow the user access to the filesystem or a command shell.

       In restricted mode, nnaannoo will _n_o_t:

       +o read or write to any file not specified on the command line;

       +o read any nanorc files;

       +o allow suspending;

       +o allow  a  file to be appended to, prepended to, or saved under a dif-
         ferent name;

       +o use backup files or spell checking.


OOPPTTIIOONNSS
       ++_L_I_N_E,,_C_O_L_U_M_N
              Places cursor at line number _L_I_N_E and column number  _C_O_L_U_M_N  (at
              least one of which must be specified) on startup, instead of the
              default of line 1, column 1.

       --??     Same as --hh ((----hheellpp)).

       --hh ((----hheellpp))
              Show a summary of command line options and exit.

       --VV ((----vveerrssiioonn))
              Show the current version number and exit.

       See the nnaannoo(1) manpage for the complete documentation of nnaannoo.
