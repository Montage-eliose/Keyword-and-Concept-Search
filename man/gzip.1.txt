       _G_z_i_p  reduces  the  size  of  the  named  files using Lempel-Ziv coding
       (LZ77).  Whenever possible, each file  is  replaced  by  one  with  the
       extension ..ggzz, while keeping the same ownership modes, access and modi-
       fication times.  (The default extension is --ggzz for VMS,  zz  for  MSDOS,
       OS/2  FAT, Windows NT FAT and Atari.)  If no files are specified, or if
       a file name is "-", the standard input is compressed  to  the  standard
       output.  _G_z_i_p will only attempt to compress regular files.  In particu-
       lar, it will ignore symbolic links.

       If the compressed file name is too long for its file system, _g_z_i_p trun-
       cates  it.   _G_z_i_p  attempts to truncate only the parts of the file name
       longer than 3 characters.  (A part is delimited by dots.) If  the  name
       consists  of  small  parts  only,  the longest parts are truncated. For
       example, if file names are limited to 14 characters, gzip.msdos.exe  is
       compressed to gzi.msd.exe.gz.  Names are not truncated on systems which
       do not have a limit on file name length.

       By default, _g_z_i_p keeps the original file name and timestamp in the com-
       pressed  file.  These  are used when decompressing the file with the --NN
       option. This is useful when the compressed file name was  truncated  or
       when the time stamp was not preserved after a file transfer.

       Compressed  files  can be restored to their original form using _g_z_i_p _-_d
       or _g_u_n_z_i_p or _z_c_a_t.  If the original name saved in the  compressed  file
       is not suitable for its file system, a new name is constructed from the
       original one to make it legal.

       _g_u_n_z_i_p takes a list of files on its command line and replaces each file
       whose  name ends with .gz, -gz, .z, -z, or _z (ignoring case) and which
       begins with the correct magic number with an uncompressed file  without
       the  original extension.  _g_u_n_z_i_p also recognizes the special extensions
       ..ttggzz and ..ttaazz as shorthands for ..ttaarr..ggzz and ..ttaarr..ZZ respectively.   When
       compressing, _g_z_i_p uses the ..ttggzz extension if necessary instead of trun-
       cating a file with a ..ttaarr extension.

       _g_u_n_z_i_p can currently decompress files created by _g_z_i_p,  _z_i_p,  _c_o_m_p_r_e_s_s,
       _c_o_m_p_r_e_s_s  _-_H  or _p_a_c_k.  The detection of the input format is automatic.
       When using the first two formats, _g_u_n_z_i_p checks a 32 bit CRC. For  _p_a_c_k
       and _g_u_n_z_i_p checks the uncompressed length. The standard _c_o_m_p_r_e_s_s format
       was not designed to allow consistency checks. However _g_u_n_z_i_p  is  some-
       times  able  to  detect  a bad .Z file. If you get an error when uncom-
       pressing a .Z file, do not assume that the .Z file  is  correct  simply
       because the standard _u_n_c_o_m_p_r_e_s_s does not complain. This generally means
       that the standard _u_n_c_o_m_p_r_e_s_s does not check its input, and happily gen-
       erates  garbage  output.   The  SCO compress -H format (lzh compression
       method) does not include a CRC but also allows some consistency checks.

       Files created by _z_i_p can be uncompressed by gzip only if  they  have  a
       single  member  compressed with the 'deflation' method. This feature is
       only intended to help conversion of tar.zip files to the tar.gz format.
       To  extract  a _z_i_p file with a single member, use a command like _g_u_n_z_i_p
       _<_f_o_o_._z_i_p or _g_u_n_z_i_p _-_S _._z_i_p _f_o_o_._z_i_p.  To extract zip files with  several
       members, use _u_n_z_i_p instead of _g_u_n_z_i_p.

       _z_c_a_t  is  identical  to  _g_u_n_z_i_p  --cc.   (On  some  systems,  _z_c_a_t may be
       installed as _g_z_c_a_t to preserve the original link  to  _c_o_m_p_r_e_s_s.)   _z_c_a_t
       uncompresses either a list of files on the command line or its standard
       input and writes the uncompressed data on standard output.   _z_c_a_t  will
       uncompress files that have the correct magic number whether they have a
       ..ggzz suffix or not.

       _G_z_i_p uses the Lempel-Ziv algorithm used in _z_i_p and PKZIP.   The  amount
       of  compression  obtained depends on the size of the input and the dis-
       tribution of common substrings.  Typically, text such as source code or
       English  is  reduced  by  60-70%.  Compression is generally much better
       than that achieved by LZW (as used in  _c_o_m_p_r_e_s_s),  Huffman  coding  (as
       used in _p_a_c_k), or adaptive Huffman coding (_c_o_m_p_a_c_t).

       Compression  is  always  performed,  even  if  the  compressed  file is
       slightly larger than the original. The worst case expansion  is  a  few
       bytes  for  the  gzip  file header, plus 5 bytes every 32K block, or an
       expansion ratio of 0.015% for large files. Note that the actual  number
       of  used  disk blocks almost never increases.  _g_z_i_p preserves the mode,
       ownership and timestamps of files when compressing or decompressing.

OOPPTTIIOONNSS
       --aa ----aasscciiii
              Ascii text mode: convert end-of-lines using  local  conventions.
              This  option  is  supported  only  on some non-Unix systems. For
              MSDOS, CR LF is converted to LF when compressing, and LF is con-
              verted to CR LF when decompressing.

       --cc ----ssttddoouutt ----ttoo--ssttddoouutt
              Write  output on standard output; keep original files unchanged.
              If there are several input  files,  the  output  consists  of  a
              sequence  of  independently compressed members. To obtain better
              compression, concatenate  all  input  files  before  compressing
              them.

       --ff ----ffoorrccee
              Force compression or decompression even if the file has multiple
              links or the corresponding file already exists, or if  the  com-
              pressed data is read from or written to a terminal. If the input
              data is not in a format recognized by _g_z_i_p, and  if  the  option
              --stdout  is  also  given, copy the input data without change to
              the standard output: let _z_c_a_t behave  as  _c_a_t.   If  --ff  is  not
              given,  and  when not running in the background, _g_z_i_p prompts to
              verify whether an existing file should be overwritten.

       --hh ----hheellpp
              Display a help screen and quit.

       --kk ----kkeeeepp
              Keep (don't delete) input files during compression or decompres-
              sion.

       --ll ----lliisstt
              For each compressed file, list the following fields:

                  compressed size: size of the compressed file
                  uncompressed size: size of the uncompressed file
                  ratio: compression ratio (0.0% if unknown)
                  uncompressed_name: name of the uncompressed file

              The  uncompressed size is given as -1 for files not in gzip for-
              mat, such as compressed .Z files. To get the  uncompressed  size
              for such a file, you can use:

                  zcat file.Z | wc -c

              In  combination  with the --verbose option, the following fields
              are also displayed:

                  method: compression method
                  crc: the 32-bit CRC of the uncompressed data
                  date & time: time stamp for the uncompressed file

              The compression methods currently supported  are  deflate,  com-
              press,  lzh  (SCO  compress  -H)  and pack.  The crc is given as
              ffffffff for a file not in gzip format.

              With --name, the uncompressed name,  date and  time   are  those
              stored within the compress file if present.

              With  --verbose,  the  size totals and compression ratio for all
              files is also displayed, unless some  sizes  are  unknown.  With
              --quiet, the title and totals lines are not displayed.

       --nn ----nnoo--nnaammee
              When  compressing,  do  not save the original file name and time
              stamp by default. (The original name is always saved if the name
              had  to  be  truncated.)  When decompressing, do not restore the
              original file name if present (remove only the _g_z_i_p suffix  from
              the  compressed  file name) and do not restore the original time
              stamp if present (copy it from the compressed file). This option
              is the default when decompressing.

       --NN ----nnaammee
              When  compressing,  always  save the original file name and time
              stamp; this is the  default.  When  decompressing,  restore  the
              original  file  name  and  time stamp if present. This option is
              useful on systems which have a limit on file name length or when
              the time stamp has been lost after a file transfer.

       --qq ----qquuiieett
              Suppress all warnings.

       --rr ----rreeccuurrssiivvee
              Travel  the  directory structure recursively. If any of the file
              names specified on the command line are directories,  _g_z_i_p  will
              descend  into  the directory and compress all the files it finds
              there (or decompress them in the case of _g_u_n_z_i_p ).

       ----rrssyynnccaabbllee
              While compressing, synchronize the output occasionally based  on
              the  input.   This  increases  size  by less than 1 percent most
              cases, but means that the rrssyynncc(1) program can take advantage of
              similarities  in  the  uncompressed  input when syncronizing two
              files compressed with this flag.  _g_u_n_z_i_p cannot tell the differ-
              ence between a compressed file created with this option, and one
              created without it.

       --SS ..ssuuff ----ssuuffffiixx ..ssuuff
              When compressing, use suffix .suf instead of .gz.  Any non-empty
              suffix  can  be given, but suffixes other than .z and .gz should
              be avoided to avoid confusion  when  files  are  transferred  to
              other systems.

              When  decompressing,  add  .suf  to the beginning of the list of
              suffixes to try, when deriving an output file name from an input
              file name.

       --tt ----tteesstt
              Test. Check the compressed file integrity.

       --vv ----vveerrbboossee
              Verbose. Display the name and percentage reduction for each file
              compressed or decompressed.

       --VV ----vveerrssiioonn
              Version. Display the version number and compilation options then
              quit.

       --## ----ffaasstt ----bbeesstt
              Regulate  the  speed of compression using the specified digit _#,
              where --11 or ----ffaasstt  indicates  the  fastest  compression  method
              (less  compression)  and --99 or ----bbeesstt indicates the slowest com-
              pression method (best  compression).   The  default  compression
              level is --66 (that is, biased towards high compression at expense
              of speed).

AADDVVAANNCCEEDD UUSSAAGGEE
       Multiple compressed files can be concatenated.  In  this  case,  _g_u_n_z_i_p
       will extract all members at once. For example:

             gzip -c file1  > foo.gz
             gzip -c file2 >> foo.gz

       Then

             gunzip -c foo

       is equivalent to

             cat file1 file2

       In  case of damage to one member of a .gz file, other members can still
       be recovered (if the damaged member is removed). However, you  can  get
       better compression by compressing all members at once:

             cat file1 file2 | gzip > foo.gz

       compresses better than

             gzip -c file1 file2 > foo.gz

       If you want to recompress concatenated files to get better compression,
       do:

             gzip -cd old.gz | gzip > new.gz

       If a compressed file consists of several members, the uncompressed size
       and  CRC reported by the --list option applies to the last member only.
       If you need the uncompressed size for all members, you can use:

             gzip -cd file.gz | wc -c

       If you wish to create a single archive file with  multiple  members  so
       that members can later be extracted independently, use an archiver such
       as tar or zip. GNU tar supports the -z option to invoke gzip  transpar-
       ently. gzip is designed as a complement to tar, not as a replacement.

EENNVVIIRROONNMMEENNTT
       The  environment  variable  GGZZIIPP  can hold a set of default options for
       _g_z_i_p.  These options are interpreted first and can  be  overwritten  by
       explicit command line parameters. For example:
             for sh:    GZIP="-8v --name"; export GZIP
             for csh:   setenv GZIP "-8v --name"
             for MSDOS: set GZIP=-8v --name

       On  Vax/VMS, the name of the environment variable is GZIP_OPT, to avoid
       a conflict with the symbol set for invocation of the program.

              The input file has links; it is left unchanged.  See  _l_n(1)  for

              ply-linked files.

CCAAVVEEAATTSS
       When writing compressed data to a tape, it is  generally  necessary  to
       pad  the  output  with  zeroes up to a block boundary. When the data is
       read and the whole block is passed to _g_u_n_z_i_p for decompression,  _g_u_n_z_i_p
       detects  that there is extra trailing garbage after the compressed data
       and emits a warning by default. You have to use the --quiet  option  to
       suppress  the  warning.  This option can be set in the GGZZIIPP environment
       variable as in:
         for sh:  GZIP="-q"  tar -xfz --block-compress /dev/rst0
         for csh: (setenv GZIP -q; tar -xfz --block-compr /dev/rst0

       In the above example, gzip is invoked implicitly by the  -z  option  of
       GNU  tar. Make sure that the same block size (-b option of tar) is used
       for reading and  writing  compressed  data  on  tapes.   (This  example
       assumes you are using the GNU version of tar.)

BBUUGGSS
       The  gzip  format  represents the input size modulo 2^32, so the --list
       option reports incorrect uncompressed sizes and compression ratios  for
       uncompressed  files  4 GB and larger.  To work around this problem, you
       can use the following command to discover a large  uncompressed  file's
       true size:

             zcat file.gz | wc -c

       The  --list  option reports sizes as -1 and crc as ffffffff if the com-
       pressed file is on a non seekable media.

       In some rare cases, the --best option gives worse compression than  the
       default  compression  level  (-6). On some highly redundant files, _c_o_m_-
       _p_r_e_s_s compresses better than _g_z_i_p.
