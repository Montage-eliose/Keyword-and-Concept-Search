       iinnnnoocchheecckkssuumm prints checksums for InnoDB files. This tool reads an
       InnoDB tablespace file, calculates the checksum for each page, compares
       the calculated checksum to the stored checksum, and reports mismatches,
       which indicate damaged pages. It was originally developed to speed up
       verifying the integrity of tablespace files after power outages but can
       also be used after file copies. Because checksum mismatches will cause
       InnoDB to deliberately shut down a running server, it can be preferable
       to use this tool rather than waiting for a server in production usage
       to encounter the damaged pages.  iinnnnoocchheecckkssuumm supports files up to 2GB
       in size.

       iinnnnoocchheecckkssuumm cannot be used on tablespace files that the server already
       has open. For such files, you should use CHECK TABLE to check tables
       within the tablespace.

       If checksum mismatches are found, you would normally restore the
       tablespace from backup or start the server and attempt to use mmyyssqqlldduummpp
       to make a backup of the tables within the tablespace.

       Invoke iinnnnoocchheecckkssuumm like this:

           shell> iinnnnoocchheecckkssuumm [[_o_p_t_i_o_n_s]] _f_i_l_e___n_a_m_e

       iinnnnoocchheecckkssuumm supports the following options. For options that refer to
       page numbers, the numbers are zero-based.

       +o   --cc

           Print a count of the number of pages in the file.

       +o   --dd

           Debug mode; prints checksums for each page.

       +o   --ee _n_u_m

           End at this page number.

       +o   --pp _n_u_m

           Check only this page number.

       +o   --ss _n_u_m

           Start at this page number.

       +o   --vv

           Verbose mode; print a progress indicator every five seconds.
