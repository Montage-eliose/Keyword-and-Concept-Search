       In the following description, _b_z_l_e_s_s and _l_e_s_s can be used  interchange-
       ably with _b_z_m_o_r_e and _m_o_r_e_.

       _B_z_m_o_r_e is a filter which allows examination of compressed or plain text
       files one screenful at a time on a soft-copy terminal.  _b_z_m_o_r_e works on
       files  compressed with _b_z_i_p_2 and also on uncompressed files.  If a file
       does not exist, _b_z_m_o_r_e looks for a file of the same name with the addi-
       tion of a .bz2 suffix.

       _B_z_m_o_r_e  normally  pauses after each screenful, printing --More-- at the
       bottom of the screen.  If the user then types a  carriage  return,  one
       more line is displayed.  If the user hits a space, another screenful is
       displayed.  Other possibilities are enumerated later.

       _B_z_m_o_r_e looks in the file _/_e_t_c_/_t_e_r_m_c_a_p to determine terminal  character-
       istics,  and to determine the default window size.  On a terminal capa-
       ble of displaying 24 lines, the default window size is 22 lines.  Other
       sequences which may be typed when _b_z_m_o_r_e pauses, and their effects, are
       as follows (_i is an optional integer argument, defaulting to 1) :

       _i<space>
              display _i more lines, (or another screenful if  no  argument  is
              given)

       ^D     display  11  more lines (a ``scroll'').  If _i is given, then the
              scroll size is set to _i.

       d      same as ^D (control-D)

       _iz     same as typing a space except that _i, if  present,  becomes  the
              new  window size.  Note that the window size reverts back to the
              default at the end of the current file.

       _is     skip _i lines and print a screenful of lines

       _if     skip _i screenfuls and print a screenful of lines

       q or Q quit reading the current file; go on to the next (if any)

       e or q When the prompt --More--(Next file: _f_i_l_e) is printed, this  com-
              mand causes bzmore to exit.

       s      When  the prompt --More--(Next file: _f_i_l_e) is printed, this com-
              mand causes bzmore to skip the next file and continue.

       =      Display the current line number.

       _i/expr search for the _i-th occurrence of the regular  expression  _e_x_p_r_.
              If the pattern is not found, _b_z_m_o_r_e goes on to the next file (if
              any).  Otherwise, a screenful is displayed, starting  two  lines
              before  the  place  where  the expression was found.  The user's
              erase and kill characters  may  be  used  to  edit  the  regular
              expression.   Erasing  back  past  the  first column cancels the
              search command.

       _in     search for the _i-th occurrence of the  last  regular  expression
              entered.

       !command
              invoke a shell with _c_o_m_m_a_n_d.  The character `!' in "command" are
              replaced with the previous shell command.  The sequence "\!"  is
              replaced by "!".

       :q or :Q
              quit  reading the current file; go on to the next (if any) (same
              as q or Q).

       .      (dot) repeat the previous command.

       The commands take effect immediately, i.e., it is not necessary to type
       a carriage return.  Up to the time when the command character itself is
       given, the user may hit the line kill character to cancel the numerical
       argument being formed.  In addition, the user may hit the erase charac-
       ter to redisplay the --More-- message.

       At any time when output is being sent to the terminal, the user can hit
       the  quit  key  (normally control-\).  _B_z_m_o_r_e will stop sending output,
       and will display the usual --More-- prompt.  The user  may  then  enter
       one  of  the  above commands in the normal manner.  Unfortunately, some
       output is lost when this is done, due to the fact that  any  characters
       waiting in the terminal's output queue are flushed when the quit signal
       occurs.

       The terminal is set to _n_o_e_c_h_o mode by this program so that  the  output
       can  be continuous.  What you type will thus not show on your terminal,
       except for the / and !  commands.

       If the standard output is not a teletype, then _b_z_m_o_r_e  acts  just  like
       _b_z_c_a_t_, except that a header is printed before each file.
