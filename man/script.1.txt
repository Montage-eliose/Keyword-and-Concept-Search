DDEESSCCRRIIPPTTIIOONN
     ssccrriipptt makes a typescript of everything printed on your terminal.  It is
     useful for students who need a hardcopy record of an interactive session
     as proof of an assignment, as the typescript file can be printed out
     later with lpr(1).

     If the argument _f_i_l_e is given, ssccrriipptt saves all dialogue in _f_i_l_e.  If no
     file name is given, the typescript is saved in the file _t_y_p_e_s_c_r_i_p_t.

     Options:

     --aa,, ----aappppeenndd
             Append the output to _f_i_l_e or _t_y_p_e_s_c_r_i_p_t, retaining the prior con-
             tents.

     --cc,, ----ccoommmmaanndd _c_o_m_m_a_n_d
             Run the _c_o_m_m_a_n_d rather than an interactive shell.  This makes it
             easy for a script to capture the output of a program that behaves
             differently when its stdout is not a tty.

     --ee,, ----rreettuurrnn
             Return the exit code of the child process.  Uses the same format
             as bash termination on signal termination exit code is 128+n.

     --ff,, ----fflluusshh
             Flush output after each write.  This is nice for telecooperation:
             one person does `mkfifo foo; script -f foo', and another can
             supervise real-time what is being done using `cat foo'.

     ----ffoorrccee
             Allow the default output destination, i.e. the typescript file,
             to be a hard or symbolic link.  The command will follow a sym-
             bolic link.

     --qq,, ----qquuiieett
             Be quiet.

     --tt,, ----ttiimmiinngg[=_f_i_l_e]
             Output timing data to standard error, or to _f_i_l_e when given.
             This data contains two fields, separated by a space.  The first
             field indicates how much time elapsed since the previous output.
             The second field indicates how many characters were output this
             time.  This information can be used to replay typescripts with
             realistic typing and output delays.

     --VV,, ----vveerrssiioonn
             Output version information and exit.

     --hh,, ----hheellpp
             Output help and exit.

     The script ends when the forked shell exits (a _c_o_n_t_r_o_l_-_D to exit the
     Bourne shell (sh(1)), and _e_x_i_t, _l_o_g_o_u_t or _c_o_n_t_r_o_l_-_d (if _i_g_n_o_r_e_e_o_f is not
     set) for the C-shell, csh(1)).

     Certain interactive commands, such as vi(1), create garbage in the type-
     script file.  SSccrriipptt works best with commands that do not manipulate the
     screen, the results are meant to emulate a hardcopy terminal.

EENNVVIIRROONNMMEENNTT
     The following environment variable is utilized by ssccrriipptt:

     SHELL  If the variable SHELL exists, the shell forked by ssccrriipptt will be
            that shell. If SHELL is not set, the Bourne shell is assumed.
            (Most shells set this variable automatically).

SSEEEE AALLSSOO
     csh(1) (for the _h_i_s_t_o_r_y mechanism), scriptreplay(1).

HHIISSTTOORRYY
     The ssccrriipptt command appeared in 3.0BSD.

BBUUGGSS
     SSccrriipptt places eevveerryytthhiinngg in the log file, including linefeeds and
     backspaces.  This is not what the naive user expects.
