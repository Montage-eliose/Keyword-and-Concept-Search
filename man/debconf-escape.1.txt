       When debconf has the 'escape' capability set, it will expect commands
       you send it to have backslashes and newlines escaped (as "\\" and "\n"
       respectively) and will in turn escape backslashes and newlines in its
       replies. This can be used, for example, to substitute multi-line
       strings into templates, or to get multi-line extended descriptions
       reliably using "METAGET".
