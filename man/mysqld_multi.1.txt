       mmyyssqqlldd__mmuullttii [[_o_p_t_i_o_n_s]] {{ssttaarrtt||ssttoopp||rreeppoorrtt}} [[_G_N_R[[,,_G_N_R]] ......]]

DDEESSCCRRIIPPTTIIOONN
       mmyyssqqlldd__mmuullttii is designed to manage several mmyyssqqlldd processes that listen
       for connections on different Unix socket files and TCP/IP ports. It can
       start or stop servers, or report their current status.

       mmyyssqqlldd__mmuullttii searches for groups named [mysqld_N] in my.cnf (or in the
       file named by the ----ddeeffaauullttss--ffiillee option).  _N can be any positive
       integer. This number is referred to in the following discussion as the
       option group number, or _G_N_R. Group numbers distinguish option groups
       from one another and are used as arguments to mmyyssqqlldd__mmuullttii to specify
       which servers you want to start, stop, or obtain a status report for.
       Options listed in these groups are the same that you would use in the
       [mysqld] group used for starting mmyyssqqlldd. (See, for example,
       Section 2.10.5, "Starting and Stopping MySQL Automatically".) However,
       when using multiple servers, it is necessary that each one use its own
       value for options such as the Unix socket file and TCP/IP port number.
       For more information on which options must be unique per server in a
       multiple-server environment, see Section 5.3, "Running Multiple MySQL
       Instances on One Machine".

       To invoke mmyyssqqlldd__mmuullttii, use the following syntax:

           shell> mmyyssqqlldd__mmuullttii [[_o_p_t_i_o_n_s]] {{ssttaarrtt||ssttoopp||rreeppoorrtt}} [[_G_N_R[[,,_G_N_R]] ......]]

       start, stop, and report indicate which operation to perform. You can
       perform the designated operation for a single server or multiple
       servers, depending on the _G_N_R list that follows the option name. If
       there is no list, mmyyssqqlldd__mmuullttii performs the operation for all servers
       in the option file.

       Each _G_N_R value represents an option group number or range of group
       numbers. The value should be the number at the end of the group name in
       the option file. For example, the _G_N_R for a group named [mysqld17] is
       17. To specify a range of numbers, separate the first and last numbers
       by a dash. The _G_N_R value 10-13 represents groups [mysqld10] through
       [mysqld13]. Multiple groups or group ranges can be specified on the
       command line, separated by commas. There must be no whitespace
       characters (spaces or tabs) in the _G_N_R list; anything after a
       whitespace character is ignored.

       This command starts a single server using option group [mysqld17]:

           shell> mmyyssqqlldd__mmuullttii ssttaarrtt 1177

       This command stops several servers, using option groups [mysqld8] and
       [mysqld10] through [mysqld13]:

           shell> mmyyssqqlldd__mmuullttii ssttoopp 88,,1100--1133

       For an example of how you might set up an option file, use this
       command:

           shell> mmyyssqqlldd__mmuullttii ----eexxaammppllee

       mmyyssqqlldd__mmuullttii searches for option files as follows:

       +o   With ----nnoo--ddeeffaauullttss, no option files are read.

       +o   With ----ddeeffaauullttss--ffiillee==_f_i_l_e___n_a_m_e, only the named file is read.

       +o   Otherwise, option files in the standard list of locations are read,
           including any file named by the ----ddeeffaauullttss--eexxttrraa--ffiillee==_f_i_l_e___n_a_m_e
           option, if one is given. (If the option is given multiple times,
           the last value is used.)

       Option files read are searched for [mysqld_multi] and [mysqld_N] option
       groups. The [mysqld_multi] group can be used for options to
       mmyyssqqlldd__mmuullttii itself.  [mysqld_N] groups can be used for options passed
       to specific mmyyssqqlldd instances.

       The [mysqld] or [mysqld_safe] groups can be used for common options
       read by all instances of mmyyssqqlldd or mmyyssqqlldd__ssaaffee. You can specify a
       ----ddeeffaauullttss--ffiillee==_f_i_l_e___n_a_m_e option to use a different configuration file
       for that instance, in which case the [mysqld] or [mysqld_safe] groups
       from that file will be used for that instance.

       mmyyssqqlldd__mmuullttii supports the following options.

       +o   ----hheellpp

           Display a help message and exit.

       +o   ----ccoonnffiigg--ffiillee==_f_i_l_e___n_a_m_e

           This option is deprecated. If given, it is treated the same way as
           ----ddeeffaauullttss--eexxttrraa--ffiillee, described earlier.  ----ccoonnffiigg--ffiillee was
           removed in MySQL 5.5.3.

       +o   ----eexxaammppllee

           Display a sample option file.

       +o   ----lloogg==_f_i_l_e___n_a_m_e

           Specify the name of the log file. If the file exists, log output is
           appended to it.

       +o   ----mmyyssqqllaaddmmiinn==_p_r_o_g___n_a_m_e

           The mmyyssqqllaaddmmiinn binary to be used to stop servers.

       +o   ----mmyyssqqlldd==_p_r_o_g___n_a_m_e

           The mmyyssqqlldd binary to be used. Note that you can specify mmyyssqqlldd__ssaaffee
           as the value for this option also. If you use mmyyssqqlldd__ssaaffee to start
           the server, you can include the mysqld or ledir options in the
           corresponding [mysqld_N] option group. These options indicate the
           name of the server that mmyyssqqlldd__ssaaffee should start and the path name
           of the directory where the server is located. (See the descriptions
           for these options in mmyyssqqlldd__ssaaffee(1).) Example:

               [mysqld38]
               mysqld = mysqld-debug
               ledir  = /opt/local/mysql/libexec

       +o   ----nnoo--lloogg

           Print log information to stdout rather than to the log file. By
           default, output goes to the log file.

       +o   ----ppaasssswwoorrdd==_p_a_s_s_w_o_r_d

           The password of the MySQL account to use when invoking mmyyssqqllaaddmmiinn.
           Note that the password value is not optional for this option,
           unlike for other MySQL programs.

       +o   ----ssiilleenntt

           Silent mode; disable warnings.

       +o   ----ttccpp--iipp

           Connect to each MySQL server through the TCP/IP port instead of the
           Unix socket file. (If a socket file is missing, the server might
           still be running, but accessible only through the TCP/IP port.) By
           default, connections are made using the Unix socket file. This
           option affects stop and report operations.

       +o   ----uusseerr==_u_s_e_r___n_a_m_e

           The user name of the MySQL account to use when invoking mmyyssqqllaaddmmiinn.

       +o   ----vveerrbboossee

           Be more verbose.

       +o   ----vveerrssiioonn

           Display version information and exit.

       Some notes about mmyyssqqlldd__mmuullttii:

       +o   MMoosstt iimmppoorrttaanntt: Before using mmyyssqqlldd__mmuullttii be sure that you
           understand the meanings of the options that are passed to the
           mmyyssqqlldd servers and _w_h_y you would want to have separate mmyyssqqlldd
           processes. Beware of the dangers of using multiple mmyyssqqlldd servers
           with the same data directory. Use separate data directories, unless
           you _k_n_o_w what you are doing. Starting multiple servers with the
           same data directory does _n_o_t give you extra performance in a
           threaded system. See Section 5.3, "Running Multiple MySQL Instances
           on One Machine".

       +o

               IImmppoorrttaanntt
               Make sure that the data directory for each server is fully
               accessible to the Unix account that the specific mmyyssqqlldd process
               is started as.  _D_o _n_o_t use the Unix _r_o_o_t account for this,
               unless you _k_n_o_w what you are doing. See Section 6.1.5, "How to
               Run MySQL as a Normal User".

       +o   Make sure that the MySQL account used for stopping the mmyyssqqlldd
           servers (with the mmyyssqqllaaddmmiinn program) has the same user name and
           password for each server. Also, make sure that the account has the
           SHUTDOWN privilege. If the servers that you want to manage have
           different user names or passwords for the administrative accounts,
           you might want to create an account on each server that has the
           same user name and password. For example, you might set up a common
           multi_admin account by executing the following commands for each
           server:

               shell> mmyyssqqll --uu rroooott --SS //ttmmpp//mmyyssqqll..ssoocckk --pp
               Enter password:
               mysql> CCRREEAATTEE UUSSEERR ''mmuullttii__aaddmmiinn''@@''llooccaallhhoosstt'' IIDDEENNTTIIFFIIEEDD BBYY ''mmuullttiippaassss'';;
               mysql> GGRRAANNTT SSHHUUTTDDOOWWNN OONN **..** TTOO ''mmuullttii__aaddmmiinn''@@''llooccaallhhoosstt'';;

           See Section 6.2, "The MySQL Access Privilege System". You have to
           do this for each mmyyssqqlldd server. Change the connection parameters
           appropriately when connecting to each one. Note that the host name
           part of the account name must permit you to connect as multi_admin
           from the host where you want to run mmyyssqqlldd__mmuullttii.

       +o   The Unix socket file and the TCP/IP port number must be different
           for every mmyyssqqlldd. (Alternatively, if the host has multiple network
           addresses, you can use ----bbiinndd--aaddddrreessss to cause different servers to
           listen to different interfaces.)

       +o   The ----ppiidd--ffiillee option is very important if you are using
           mmyyssqqlldd__ssaaffee to start mmyyssqqlldd (for example, ----mmyyssqqlldd==mmyyssqqlldd__ssaaffee)
           Every mmyyssqqlldd should have its own process ID file. The advantage of
           using mmyyssqqlldd__ssaaffee instead of mmyyssqqlldd is that mmyyssqqlldd__ssaaffee monitors
           its mmyyssqqlldd process and restarts it if the process terminates due to
           a signal sent using kill -9 or for other reasons, such as a
           segmentation fault. Please note that the mmyyssqqlldd__ssaaffee script might
           require that you start it from a certain place. This means that you
           might have to change location to a certain directory before running
           mmyyssqqlldd__mmuullttii. If you have problems starting, please see the
           mmyyssqqlldd__ssaaffee script. Check especially the lines:

               ----------------------------------------------------------------
               MY_PWD=`pwd`
               # Check if we are starting this relative (for the binary release)
               if test -d $MY_PWD/data/mysql -a \
                  -f ./share/mysql/english/errmsg.sys -a \
                  -x ./bin/mysqld
               ----------------------------------------------------------------

           The test performed by these lines should be successful, or you
           might encounter problems. See mmyyssqqlldd__ssaaffee(1).

       +o   You might want to use the ----uusseerr option for mmyyssqqlldd, but to do this
           you need to run the mmyyssqqlldd__mmuullttii script as the Unix superuser
           (root). Having the option in the option file doesn't matter; you
           just get a warning if you are not the superuser and the mmyyssqqlldd
           processes are started under your own Unix account.

       The following example shows how you might set up an option file for use
       with mmyyssqqlldd__mmuullttii. The order in which the mmyyssqqlldd programs are started
       or stopped depends on the order in which they appear in the option
       file. Group numbers need not form an unbroken sequence. The first and
       fifth [mysqld_N] groups were intentionally omitted from the example to
       illustrate that you can have "gaps" in the option file. This gives you
       more flexibility.

           # This is an example of a my.cnf file for mysqld_multi.
           # Usually this file is located in home dir ~/.my.cnf or /etc/my.cnf
           [mysqld_multi]

           mysqladmin = /usr/local/mysql/bin/mysqladmin
           user       = multi_admin

           datadir    = /usr/local/mysql/data6
           language   = /usr/local/mysql/share/mysql/japanese
