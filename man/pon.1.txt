DDEESSCCRRIIPPTTIIOONN
       This manual page describes the ppoonn, pplloogg and ppooffff scripts, which  allow
       users to control PPP connections.

   ppoonn
       ppoonn,  invoked without arguments, runs the _/_e_t_c_/_p_p_p_/_p_p_p___o_n___b_o_o_t file, if
       it exists and is  executable.  Otherwise,  a  PPP  connection  will  be
       started  using configuration from _/_e_t_c_/_p_p_p_/_p_e_e_r_s_/_p_r_o_v_i_d_e_r.  This is the
       default behaviour unless an iisspp--nnaammee argument is given.

       For instance, to use ISP configuration "myisp" run:

              pon myisp

       ppoonn will then use the options file _/_e_t_c_/_p_p_p_/_p_e_e_r_s_/_m_y_i_s_p.  You can  pass
       additional  ppppppdd  ooppttiioonnss  after the ISP name, too.  ppoonn can be used to
       run multiple, simultaneous PPP connections.

       ppoonn takes the following command line options:

              --qq ----qquuiicckk
                     disconnect when ip-up finishes running.  This function is
                     only available to the _r_o_o_t user.

   ppooffff
       ppooffff  closes  a PPP connection. If more than one PPP connection exists,
       the one named in the argument to ppooffff will be killed, e.g.

              poff myprovider2

       will terminate the connection to myprovider2, and leave the PPP connec-
       tions to e.g. "myprovider1" or "myprovider3" up and running.

       ppooffff takes the following command line options:

              --rr     causes the connection to be redialed after it is dropped.

              --dd     toggles the state of pppd's debug option.

              --cc     causes ppppppdd(8) to renegotiate compression.

              --aa     stops  all  running  ppp  connections.  If  the  argument
                     iisspp--nnaammee is given it will be ignored.

              --hh     displays help information.

              --vv     prints the version and exits.

              If no argument is given, ppooffff will stop or signal  pppd  if  and
              only  if  there is exactly one running. If more than one connec-
              tion is active, it will exit with an error code of 1.

   pplloogg
       pplloogg shows you the last few lines of  _/_v_a_r_/_l_o_g_/_p_p_p_._l_o_g.  If  that  file
       doesn't  exist, it shows you the last few lines of your _/_v_a_r_/_l_o_g_/_s_y_s_l_o_g
       file, but excluding the lines not generated by pppd.  This script makes
       use  of the ttaaiill(1) command, so arguments that can be passed to ttaaiill(1)
       can also be passed to pplloogg.

       Note: the pplloogg script can only be used by root or another system admin-
       istrator  in  group  "adm",  due to security reasons. Also, to have all
       pppd-generated information in one logfile, that plog can show, you need
       the following line in your _/_e_t_c_/_s_y_s_l_o_g_._c_o_n_f file:

       local2.*       -/var/log/ppp.log
