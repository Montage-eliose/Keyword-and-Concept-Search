       nnaammeeii  uses  its  arguments as pathnames to any type of Unix file (sym-
       links, files, directories, and so  forth).   nnaammeeii  then  follows  each
       pathname  until  an  endpoint  is  found (a file, a directory, a device
       node, etc).  If it finds a symbolic link, it shows the link, and starts
       following it, indenting the output to show the context.

       This  program is useful for finding "too many levels of symbolic links"
       problems.

       For each line of output, nnaammeeii uses the following characters  to  iden-
       tify the file type found:

          f: = the pathname currently being resolved
           d = directory
           l = symbolic link (both the link and its contents are output)
           s = socket
           b = block device
           c = character device
           p = FIFO (named pipe)
           - = regular file
           ? = an error of some kind

       nnaammeeii prints an informative message when the maximum number of symbolic
       links this system can have has been exceeded.
