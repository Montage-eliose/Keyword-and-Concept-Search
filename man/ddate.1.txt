       ddate - convert Gregorian dates to Discordian dates

DDEESSCCRRIIPPTTIIOONN
       ddddaattee prints the date in Discordian date format.

       If  called  with  no arguments, ddddaattee will get the current system date,
       convert this to the Discordian date format and print this on the  stan-
       dard  output.  Alternatively,  a Gregorian date may be specified on the
       command line, in the form of a numerical day, month and year.

       If a format string is specified, the Discordian date will be printed in
       a format specified by the string. This mechanism works similarly to the
       format string mechanism of ddaattee((11)),, only almost completely differently.
       The fields are:

       %A     Full name of the day of the week (i.e., Sweetmorn)

       %a     Abbreviated name of the day of the week (i.e., SM)

       %B     Full name of the season (i.e., Chaos)

       %b     Abbreviated name of the season (i.e., Chs)

       %d     Ordinal number of day in season (i.e., 23)

       %e     Cardinal number of day in season (i.e., 23rd)

       %H     Name of current Holyday, if any

       %N     Magic  code  to prevent rest of format from being printed unless
              today is a Holyday.

       %n     Newline

       %t     Tab

       %X     Number of days remaining until X-Day. (Not valid if  the  SubGe-
              nius options are not compiled in.)

       %{

       %}     Used  to  enclose the part of the string which is to be replaced
              with the words "St. Tib's Day" if the current day is  St.  Tib's
              Day.

BBUUGGSS
       ddddaattee((11))  will  produce undefined behavior if asked to produce the date
       for St. Tib's day and its format string does not contain the St.  Tib's
       Day delimiters %{ and %}.


NNOOTTEE
       After  `X-Day'  passed  without  incident,  the Church of the SubGenius
       declared that it had got the year upside down - X-Day  is  actually  in
       8661 AD rather than 1998 AD.  Thus, the True X-Day is Cfn 40, 9827.
