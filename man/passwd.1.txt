DDEESSCCRRIIPPTTIIOONN
       The ppaasssswwdd command changes passwords for user accounts. A normal user
       may only change the password for his/her own account, while the
       superuser may change the password for any account.  ppaasssswwdd also changes
       the account or associated password validity period.

   PPaasssswwoorrdd CChhaannggeess
       The user is first prompted for his/her old password, if one is present.
       This password is then encrypted and compared against the stored
       password. The user has only one chance to enter the correct password.
       The superuser is permitted to bypass this step so that forgotten
       passwords may be changed.

       After the password has been entered, password aging information is
       checked to see if the user is permitted to change the password at this
       time. If not, ppaasssswwdd refuses to change the password and exits.

       The user is then prompted twice for a replacement password. The second
       entry is compared against the first and both are required to match in
       order for the password to be changed.

       Then, the password is tested for complexity. As a general guideline,
       passwords should consist of 6 to 8 characters including one or more
       characters from each of the following sets:

       +o   lower case alphabetics

       +o   digits 0 thru 9

       +o   punctuation marks

       Care must be taken not to include the system default erase or kill
       characters.  ppaasssswwdd will reject any password which is not suitably
       complex.

       The security of a password depends upon the strength of the encryption
       algorithm and the size of the key space. The legacy _U_N_I_X System
       encryption method is based on the NBS DES algorithm. More recent
       methods are now recommended (see EENNCCRRYYPPTT__MMEETTHHOODD). The size of the key
       space depends upon the randomness of the password which is selected.

       Compromises in password security normally result from careless password
       selection or handling. For this reason, you should not select a
       password which appears in a dictionary or which must be written down.
       The password should also not be a proper name, your license number,
       birth date, or street address. Any of these may be used as guesses to
       violate system security.

       You can find advices on how to choose a strong password on
       http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Password_strength

OOPPTTIIOONNSS
       The options which apply to the ppaasssswwdd command are:

       --aa, ----aallll
           This option can be used only with --SS and causes show status for all
           users.

       --dd, ----ddeelleettee
           Delete a user's password (make it empty). This is a quick way to
           disable a password for an account. It will set the named account
           passwordless.

       --ee, ----eexxppiirree
           Immediately expire an account's password. This in effect can force
           a user to change his/her password at the user's next login.

       --hh, ----hheellpp
           Display help message and exit.

       --ii, ----iinnaaccttiivvee _I_N_A_C_T_I_V_E
           This option is used to disable an account after the password has
           been expired for a number of days. After a user account has had an
           expired password for _I_N_A_C_T_I_V_E days, the user may no longer sign on
           to the account.

       --kk, ----kkeeeepp--ttookkeennss
           Indicate password change should be performed only for expired
           authentication tokens (passwords). The user wishes to keep their
           non-expired tokens as before.

       --ll, ----lloocckk
           Lock the password of the named account. This option disables a
           password by changing it to a value which matches no possible
           encrypted value (it adds a '!' at the beginning of the password).

           Note that this does not disable the account. The user may still be
           able to login using another authentication token (e.g. an SSH key).
           To disable the account, administrators should use uusseerrmmoodd
           ----eexxppiirreeddaattee 11 (this set the account's expire date to Jan 2, 1970).

           Users with a locked password are not allowed to change their
           password.

       --nn, ----mmiinnddaayyss _M_I_N___D_A_Y_S
           Set the minimum number of days between password changes to
           _M_I_N___D_A_Y_S. A value of zero for this field indicates that the user
           may change his/her password at any time.

       --qq, ----qquuiieett
           Quiet mode.

       --rr, ----rreeppoossiittoorryy _R_E_P_O_S_I_T_O_R_Y
           change password in _R_E_P_O_S_I_T_O_R_Y repository

       --RR, ----rroooott _C_H_R_O_O_T___D_I_R
           Apply changes in the _C_H_R_O_O_T___D_I_R directory and use the configuration
           files from the _C_H_R_O_O_T___D_I_R directory.

       --SS, ----ssttaattuuss
           Display account status information. The status information consists
           of 7 fields. The first field is the user's login name. The second
           field indicates if the user account has a locked password (L), has
           no password (NP), or has a usable password (P). The third field
           gives the date of the last password change. The next four fields
           are the minimum age, maximum age, warning period, and inactivity
           period for the password. These ages are expressed in days.

       --uu, ----uunnlloocckk
           Unlock the password of the named account. This option re-enables a
           password by changing the password back to its previous value (to
           the value before using the --ll option).

       --ww, ----wwaarrnnddaayyss _W_A_R_N___D_A_Y_S
           Set the number of days of warning before a password change is
           required. The _W_A_R_N___D_A_Y_S option is the number of days prior to the
           password expiring that a user will be warned that his/her password
           is about to expire.

       --xx, ----mmaaxxddaayyss _M_A_X___D_A_Y_S
           Set the maximum number of days a password remains valid. After
           _M_A_X___D_A_Y_S, the password is required to be changed.

CCAAVVEEAATTSS
       Password complexity checking may vary from site to site. The user is
       urged to select a password as complex as he or she feels comfortable
       with.

       Users may not be able to change their password on a system if NIS is
       enabled and they are not logged into the NIS server.

       ppaasssswwdd uses PAM to authenticate users and to change their passwords.

FFIILLEESS
       /etc/passwd
           User account information.

       /etc/shadow
           Secure user account information.

       /etc/pam.d/passwd
           PAM configuration for ppaasssswwdd.

EEXXIITT VVAALLUUEESS
       The ppaasssswwdd command exits with the following values:

       _0
           success

       _1
           permission denied

       _2
           invalid combination of options

       _3
           unexpected failure, nothing done

       _4
