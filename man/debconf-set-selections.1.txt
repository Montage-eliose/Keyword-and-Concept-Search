       ddeebbccoonnff--sseett--sseelleeccttiioonnss can be used to pre-seed the debconf database
       with answers, or to change answers in the database. Each question will
       be marked as seen to prevent debconf from asking the question
       interactively.

       Reads from a file if a filename is given, otherwise from stdin.

       Only use this command to seed debconf values for packages that will be
       or are installed. Otherwise you can end up with values in the database
       for uninstalled packages that will not go away, or with worse problems
       involving shared values. It is recommended that this only be used to
       seed the database if the originating machine has an identical install.

       The data is a series of lines. Lines beginning with a # character are
       comments. Blank lines are ignored. All other lines set the value of one
       question, and should contain four values, each separated by one
       character of whitespace. The first value is the name of the package
       that owns the question. The second is the name of the question, the
       third value is the type of this question, and the fourth value (through
       the end of the line) is the value to use for the answer of the
       question.

       Alternatively, the third value can be "seen"; then the preseed line
       only controls whether the question is marked as seen in debconf's
       database. Note that preseeding a question's value defaults to marking
       that question as seen, so to override the default value without marking
       a question seen, you need two lines.

       Lines can be continued to the next line by ending them with a "\"
       character.
