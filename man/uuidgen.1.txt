       The uuuuiiddggeenn program creates (and prints) a new universally unique iden-
       tifier (UUID) using the lliibbuuuuiidd(3) library.  The new UUID  can  reason-
       ably  be considered unique among all UUIDs created on the local system,
       and among UUIDs created on other systems in the past and in the future.

       There are two types of UUIDs which  uuuuiiddggeenn  can  generate:  time-based
       UUIDs  and random-based UUIDs.  By default uuuuiiddggeenn will generate a ran-
       dom-based UUID if a high-quality random number  generator  is  present.
       Otherwise,  it  will choose a time-based UUID.  It is possible to force
       the generation of one of these two UUID types by using  the  --rr  or  --tt
       options.

       --rr, ----rraannddoomm
              Generate  a  random-based UUID.  This method creates a UUID con-
              sisting mostly of random bits.  It requires that  the  operating
              system  have  a  high  quality  random number generator, such as
              _/_d_e_v_/_r_a_n_d_o_m.

       --tt, ----ttiimmee
              Generate a time-based UUID.  This method creates a UUID based on
              the system clock plus the system's ethernet hardware address, if
              present.
