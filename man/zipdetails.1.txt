       zipdetails - display the internal structure of zip files

       Zipdetails displays information about the internal record structure of
       the zip file. It is not concerned with displaying any details of the
       compressed data stored in the zip file.

       The program assumes prior understanding of the internal structure of a
       Zip file. You should have a copy of the Zip APPNOTE file at hand to
       help understand the output from this program ("SEE ALSO" for details).

       -v   Enable Verbose mode

       -h   Display help

       By default zipdetails will output the details of the zip file in three
       columns.

       Column 1
            This contains the offset from the start of the file in hex.

       Column 2
            This contains a textual description of the field.

       Column 3
            If the field contains a numeric value it will be displayed in hex.
            Zip stored most numbers in little-endian format - the value
            displayed will have the little-endian encoding removed.

            Next, is an optional description of what the value means.

       If the "-v" option is present, column 1 is expanded to include

       +o    The offset from the start of the file in hex.

       +o    The length of the filed in hex.

       +o    A hex dump of the bytes in field in the order they are stored in
            the zip file.

TTOODDOO
       Error handling is still a work in progress.  If the program encounters
       a problem reading a zip file it is likely to terminate with an
       unhelpful error message.

       The primary reference for Zip files is the "appnote" document available
       at <http://www.pkware.com/documents/casestudies/APPNOTE.TXT>.

       An alternative is the Info-Zip appnote. This is available from
       <ftp://ftp.info-zip.org/pub/infozip/doc/>

       The "zipinfo" program that comes with the info-zip distribution
       (<http://www.info-zip.org/>) can also display details of the structure
       of a zip file.

       See also IO::Compress::Zip, IO::Uncompress::Unzip.
