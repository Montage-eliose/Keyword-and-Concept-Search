       ucfr  -  Update  Configuration  File Registry:  associate packages with
       configuration files

       Where _P_a_c_k_a_g_e is the package associated  with  the  configuration  file
       (and,  in some sense, its owner), and _P_a_t_h _t_o _c_o_n_f_i_g_u_r_a_t_i_o_n _f_i_l_e is the
       full path to the location (usually under /etc) where the  configuration
       file lives, and is potentially modified by the end user.

       This  script  maintains  an association between configuration files and
       packages, and is meant to help provide facilities  that  _d_p_k_g  provides
       conffiles  for configuration files and not shipped in a DDeebbiiaann package,
       but handled by the postinst by _u_c_f instead. This script is  idempotent,
       associating  a package to a file multiple times is not an error.  It is
       normally an error to try to associate a file which is  already  associ-
       ated  with  another  package,  but this can be over ridden by using the
       _-_-_f_o_r_c_e option.

OOPPTTIIOONNSS
       --hh,, ----hheellpp
              Print a short usage message

       --nn,, ----nnoo--aaccttiioonn
              Dry run. Print the actions that would be taken if the script  is
              invoked, but take no action.

       --dd [[nn]],, ----ddeebbuugg [[nn]]
              Set the debug level to the (optional) level _n (n defaults to 1).
              This turns on copious debugging information.

       --pp,, ----ppuurrggee
              Removes all vestiges of the association between the named  pack-
              age  and  the configuration file from the registry. The associa-
              tion must already exist; if the configuration file is associated
              with  some  other  package,  an error happens, unless the option
              _-_-_f_o_r_c_e is also given. In that case, the  any  associations  for
              the configuration file are removed from the registry, whether or
              not the package name matches. This action is idempotent,  asking
              for  an  association to be purged multiple times does not result
              in an error, since attempting to remove an non-existent associa-
              tion is silently ignored unless the _-_-_v_e_r_b_o_s_e option is used (in
              which case it just issues a diagnostic).

       --vv,, ----vveerrbboossee
              Make the script be very verbose  about  setting  internal  vari-
              ables.

       --ff,, ----ffoorrccee
              This  option  forces operations requested even if the configura-
              tion file in consideration is owned  by  another  package.  This
              allows  a  package  to  _h_i_j_a_c_k a configuration file from another
              package, or to purge the association between the file  and  some
              other package in the registry.

       ----ssttaattee--ddiirr //ppaatthh//ttoo//ddiirr
              Set  the  state directory to /path/to/dir instead of the default
              _/_v_a_r_/_l_i_b_/_u_c_f_.  Used mostly for testing.

UUSSAAGGEE
       The most common case usage is pretty simple: a single  line  invocation
       in  the postinst on configure, and another single line in the postrm to
       tell uuccffrr to forget about the association with the  configuration  file
       on  purge  (using  the  --purge option) is all that is needed (assuming
       ucfr is still on the system).

       integer, where previous versions of the registry are stored.

       If the package _f_o_o wants to use ucfr to associate itself with a config-
       uration file _f_o_o_._c_o_n_f_, a simple invocation of ucfr in the postinst file
       is all that is needed:

       uuccffrr _f_o_o _/_e_t_c_/_f_o_o_._c_o_n_f

       On  purge,  one  should tell ucf to forget about the file (see detailed
       examples in /usr/share/doc/examples):

       uuccffrr _-_-_p_u_r_g_e _f_o_o _/_e_t_c_/_f_o_o_._c_o_n_f
