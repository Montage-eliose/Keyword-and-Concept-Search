       This manual page documents briefly the iinnssttaallll--iinnffoo command.  This man-
       ual page was written for the Debian GNU/Linux distribution because  the
       original script was designed for Debian packaging system.

       iinnssttaallll--iinnffoo is a wrapper around GNU install-info. If it is called from
       a normal shell or script it acts like GNU  install-info  by  forwarding
       all options to ginstall-info.

       If  it is called from a maintainer script it gives a warning to rebuild
       packages and does nothing, since info file installation is now done via
       triggers.

OOPPTTIIOONNSS
       Same as with GNU install-info, see ginstall-info(1).
