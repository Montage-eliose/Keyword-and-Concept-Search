       hhoossttnnaammeeccttll may be used to query and change the system hostname and
       related settings.

       This tool distinguishes three different host names: the high-level
       "pretty" hostname which might include all kinds of special characters
       (e.g. "Lennart's Laptop"), the static hostname which is used to
       initialize the kernel hostname at boot (e.g. "lennarts-laptop"), and
       the transient hostname which might be assigned temporarily due to
       network configuration and might revert back to the static hostname if
       network connectivity is lost and is only temporarily written to the
       kernel hostname (e.g. "dhcp-47-11").

       Note that the pretty hostname has little restrictions on the characters
       used, while the static and transient hostnames are limited to the
       usually accepted characters of internet domain names.

       The static host name is stored in /etc/hostname, see hhoossttnnaammee(5) for
       more information. The pretty host name, chassis type and icon name are
       stored in /etc/machine-info, see mmaacchhiinnee--iidd(5).

       The following options are understood:

       --hh, ----hheellpp
           Prints a short help text and exits.

       ----vveerrssiioonn
           Prints a short version string and exits.

       ----nnoo--aasskk--ppaasssswwoorrdd
           Don't query the user for authentication for privileged operations.

       --HH, ----hhoosstt
           Execute the operation remotely. Specify a hostname, or username and
           hostname separated by @, to connect to. This will use SSH to talk
           to a remote system.

       ----ssttaattiicc, ----ttrraannssiieenntt, ----pprreettttyy
           If sseett--hhoossttnnaammee is invoked and one or more of these options are
           passed only the selected hostnames is updated.

       The following commands are understood:

       ssttaattuuss
           Show current system hostname and related information.

       sseett--hhoossttnnaammee [[NNAAMMEE]]
           Set the system hostname. By default this will alter the pretty, the
           static, and the transient hostname alike, however if one or more of
           ----ssttaattiicc, ----ttrraannssiieenntt, ----pprreettttyy are used only the selected
           hostnames are changed. If the pretty hostname is being set, and
           static or transient are being set as well the specified host name
           will be simplified in regards to the character set used before the
           latter are updated. This is done by replacing spaces by "-" and
           removing special characters. This ensures that the pretty and the
           static hostname are always closely related while still following
           the validity rules of the specific name. This simplification of the
           hostname string is not done if only the transient and/or static
           host names are set, and the pretty host name is left untouched.
           Pass the empty string "" as hostname to reset the selected
           hostnames to their default (usually "localhost").

       sseett--iiccoonn--nnaammee [[NNAAMMEE]]
           Set the system icon name. The icon name is used by some graphical
           applications to visualize this host. The icon name should follow
           the IIccoonn NNaammiinngg SSppeecciiffiiccaattiioonn[1]. Pass an empty string to this
           operation to reset the icon name to the default value which is
           determined from chassis type (see below) and possibly other
           parameters.

       sseett--cchhaassssiiss [[TTYYPPEE]]
           Set the chassis type. The chassis type is used by some graphical
           applications to visualize the host or alter user interaction.
           Currently, the following chassis types are defined: desktop,
           laptop, server, tablet, handset, as well as the special chassis
           types vm and container for virtualized systems that lack an
           immediate physical chassis. Pass an empty string to this operation
           to reset the chassis type to the default value which is determined
           from the firmware and possibly other parameters.

       On success 0 is returned, a non-zero failure code otherwise.
