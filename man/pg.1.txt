       ppgg  displays  a  text  file on a CRT one screenful at once.  After each
       page, a prompt is displayed.  The user may then either press  the  new-
       line key to view the next page or one of the keys described below.

       If  no  filename  is  given on the command line, ppgg reads from standard
       input.  If standard output is not a terminal, ppgg acts like  _c_a_t(1)  but
       precedes each file with its name if there is more than one.

       If  input  comes from a pipe, ppgg stores the data in a buffer file while
       reading to make navigation possible.

OOPPTTIIOONNSS
       ppgg accepts the following options:

       --_n_u_m_b_e_r
              The number of lines per page.  Usually, this is  the  number  of
              CRT lines minus one.

       --cc     Clear  the  screen  before  a page is displayed, if the terminfo
              entry for the terminal provides this capability.

       --ee     Do not pause and display (EOF) at the end of a file.

       --ff     Do not split long lines.

       --nn     Without this option, commands must be terminated  by  a  newline
              character.   With this option, ppgg advances once a command letter
              is entered.

       --pp _s_t_r_i_n_g
              Instead of the normal prompt _:, _s_t_r_i_n_g is displayed.  If  _s_t_r_i_n_g
              contains  _%_d,  its first occurrence is replaced by the number of
              the current page.

       --rr     Disallow the shell escape.

       --ss     Print messages in _s_t_a_n_d_o_u_t mode, if the terminfo entry  for  the
              terminal provides this capability.

       ++_n_u_m_b_e_r
              Start at the given line.

       ++//_p_a_t_t_e_r_n//
              Start  at  the line containing the Basic Regular Expression _p_a_t_-
              _t_e_r_n given.

UUSSAAGGEE
       The following commands may be entered at the prompt.  Commands preceded
       by  _i  in  this document accept a number as argument, positive or nega-
       tive.  If this argument starts with _+ or _-_, it is interpreted  relative
       to  the  current  position in the input file, otherwise relative to the
       beginning.

       _i<<nneewwlliinnee>>
              Display the next or the indicated page.

       _idd or ^^DD
              Display the next halfpage.  If _i is given, it is  always  inter-
              preted relative to the current position.

       _ill     Display the next or the indicated line.

       _iff     Skip  a page forward.  _i must be a positive number and is always
              interpreted relative to the current position.

       _iww or _izz
              Behave as _<_n_e_w_l_i_n_e_> except that _i becomes the new page size.

       .. or ^^LL
              Redraw the screen.

       $$      Advance to the last line of the input file.

       _i//_p_a_t_t_e_r_n//
              Search forward until the first or the  _i-th  occurrence  of  the
              Basic  Regular  Expression  _p_a_t_t_e_r_n is found.  The search starts
              after the current page and stops at the end  of  the  file.   No
              wrap-around is performed.  _i must be a positive number.

       _i??_p_a_t_t_e_r_n?? or _i^^_p_a_t_t_e_r_n^^
              Search  backward  until  the first or the _i-th occurrence of the
              Basic Regular Expression _p_a_t_t_e_r_n is found.   The  search  starts
              before  the current page and stops at the beginning of the file.
              No wrap-around is performed.  _i must be a positive number.

       The search commands accept an added letter.  If tt is  given,  the  line
       containing  the pattern is displayed at the top of the screen, which is
       the default.  mm selects the middle and bb the bottom of the screen.  The
       selected position is used in following searches, too.

       _inn     Advance to the next file or _i files forward.

       _ipp     Reread the previous file or _i files backward.

       ss _f_i_l_e_n_a_m_e
              Save the current file to the given _f_i_l_e_n_a_m_e_.

       hh      Display a command summary.

       !!_c_o_m_m_a_n_d
              Execute _c_o_m_m_a_n_d using the shell.

       qq or QQ Quit.

       If  the  user presses the interrupt or quit key while ppgg reads from the
       input file or writes on the terminal, ppgg will immediately  display  the
       prompt.  In all other situations these keys will terminate ppgg.

       The following environment variables affect the behaviour of ppgg:

       CCOOLLUUMMNNSS

       ppgg expects the terminal tabulators to be set every eight positions.

       Files that include NUL characters cannot be displayed by ppgg.
