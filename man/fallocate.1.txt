       ffaallllooccaattee  is  used  to  preallocate blocks to a file.  For filesystems
       which support the fallocate system call, this is done quickly by  allo-
       cating blocks and marking them as uninitialized, requiring no IO to the
       data blocks.  This is much faster than creating a file  by  filling  it
       with zeros.

       As  of the Linux Kernel v2.6.31, the fallocate system call is supported
       by the btrfs, ext4, ocfs2, and xfs filesystems.

       The exit code returned by ffaallllooccaattee is 0 on success and 1 on failure.

       The _l_e_n_g_t_h and _o_f_f_s_e_t arguments may be followed by  binary  (2^N)  suf-
       fixes  KiB,  MiB, GiB, TiB, PiB and EiB (the "iB" is optional, e.g. "K"
       has the same meaning as "KiB") or decimal (10^N) suffixes KB,  MB,  GB,
       PB and EB.

       --hh,, ----hheellpp
              Print help and exit.

              Do  not  modify the apparent length of the file. This may effec-
              tively allocate blocks past EOF, which can  be  removed  with  a
              truncate.

              Specifies the beginning offset of the allocation, in bytes.
