       mmyyssqqll__sseettppeerrmmiissssiioonn is a Perl script that was originally written and
       contributed by Luuk de Boer. It interactively sets permissions in the
       MySQL grant tables.  mmyyssqqll__sseettppeerrmmiissssiioonn is written in Perl and
       requires that the DBI and DBD::mysql Perl modules be installed (see
       Section 2.13, "Perl Installation Notes").

       Invoke mmyyssqqll__sseettppeerrmmiissssiioonn like this:

           shell> mmyyssqqll__sseettppeerrmmiissssiioonn [[_o_p_t_i_o_n_s]]

       _o_p_t_i_o_n_s should be either ----hheellpp to display the help message, or options
       that indicate how to connect to the MySQL server. The account used when
       you connect determines which permissions you have when attempting to
       modify existing permissions in the grant tables.

       mmyyssqqll__sseettppeerrmmiissssiioonnss also reads options from the [client] and [perl]
       groups in the .my.cnf file in your home directory, if the file exists.

       mmyyssqqll__sseettppeerrmmiissssiioonn supports the following options:

       +o   ----hheellpp

           Display a help message and exit.

       +o   ----hhoosstt==_h_o_s_t___n_a_m_e

           Connect to the MySQL server on the given host.

       +o   ----ppaasssswwoorrdd==_p_a_s_s_w_o_r_d

           The password to use when connecting to the server. Note that the
           password value is not optional for this option, unlike for other
           MySQL programs.

           Specifying a password on the command line should be considered
           insecure. See Section 6.1.2.1, "End-User Guidelines for Password
           Security". You can use an option file to avoid giving the password
           on the command line.

       +o   ----ppoorrtt==_p_o_r_t___n_u_m

           The TCP/IP port number to use for the connection.

       +o   ----ssoocckkeett==_p_a_t_h

           For connections to localhost, the Unix socket file to use.

       +o   ----uusseerr==_u_s_e_r___n_a_m_e

           The MySQL user name to use when connecting to the server.
