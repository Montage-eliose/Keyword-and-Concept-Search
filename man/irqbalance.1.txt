       The purpose of iirrqqbbaallaannccee is distribute hardware interrupts across pro-
       cessors on a multiprocessor system in order to increase performance.

              Set the policy for how irq kernel affinity hinting  is  treated.
              Can be one of:

       _e_x_a_c_t irq affinity hint is applied unilaterally and never violated

       _s_u_b_s_e_t irq is balanced, but the assigned object will be a subset of the
       affintiy hint

       _i_g_n_o_r_e irq affinity hint value is completely ignored


       ----ppoowweerrtthhrreesshh==<<tthhrreesshhoolldd>>
              Set the threshold at which we attempt to move a cpu into  power-
              save mode If more than <threshold> cpus are more than 1 standard
              deviation below the average cpu softirq workload,  and  no  cpus
              are  more  than 1 standard deviation above (and have more than 1
              irq assigned to them), attempt to place 1 cpu in powersave mode.
              In  powersave mode, a cpu will not have any irqs balanced to it,
              in an effort to prevent that cpu from waking up without need.


       ----bbaanniirrqq==<<iirrqqnnuumm>>
              Add the specified irq to the set of banned irqs. irqbalance will
              not affect the affinity of any irqs on the banned list, allowing
              them to be specified manually.  This option is addative and  can
              be  specified  multiple times. For example to ban irqs 43 and 44
              from balancing,  use  the  following  command  line:  iirrqqbbaallaannccee
              ----bbaanniirrqq==4433 ----bbaanniirrqq==4444



       ----ppoolliiccyyssccrriipptt==<<ssccrriipptt>>
              When specified, the referenced script will execute once for each
              discovered irq, with the sysfs device path and irq number passed
              as  arguments.   The  script  may specify zero or more key=value
              pairs that will guide irqbalance in the management of that  irq.
              Key=value  pairs are printed by the script on stdout and will be
              captured and interpreted by irqbalance.   Irqbalance  expects  a
              zero  exit code from the provided utility.  Recognized key=value
              pairs are:

       _b_a_n_=_[_t_r_u_e _| _f_a_l_s_e_]

       Directs irqbalance to exclude the passed in irq from balancing

       _b_a_l_a_n_c_e___l_e_v_e_l_=_[_n_o_n_e _| _p_a_c_k_a_g_e _| _c_a_c_h_e _| _c_o_r_e_]
              This allows a user to override the balance level of a given irq.
              By  default  the balance level is determined automatically based
              on the pci device class of the device that owns the irq.

       _n_u_m_a___n_o_d_e_=_<_i_n_t_e_g_e_r_>
              This allows a user to override the numa node  that  sysfs  indi-
              cates  a  given device irq is local to.  Often, systems will not
              specify this information in ACPI, and as a result  devicesa  are
              considered  equidistant  from  all numa nodes in a system.  This
              option allows for that hardware provided information to be over-
              ridden,  so  that  irqbalance  can  bias  irq affinity for these
              devices toward its most local node.  Note that specifying  a  -1
              here forces irqbalance to consider an interrupt from a device to
              be equidistant from all nodes.

       ----ppiidd==<<ffiillee>>
              Have irqbalance write its process id to the specified file.   By
              default no pidfile is written.  The written pidfile is automati-
              cally unlinked when irqbalance exits.
