       soelim - interpret .so requests in groff input

       ssooeelliimm [--CCrrttvv] [--II _d_i_r] [_f_i_l_e_s _._._.]

       It  is  possible  to have whitespace between the --II command line option
       and its parameter.

DDEESSCCRRIIPPTTIIOONN
       ssooeelliimm reads _f_i_l_e_s and replaces lines of the form

              ..ssoo _f_i_l_e

       by the contents of _f_i_l_e.  It is useful if files included with ..ssoo  need
       to  be  preprocessed.   Normally,  ssooeelliimm should be invoked with the --ss
       option of ggrrooffff.

       To embed `\' in the file name, write `\\' or `\e'.  To embed  a  space,
       write  `\ '.  Any other escape sequence in _f_i_l_e makes ssooeelliimm ignore the
       whole line.

       Note that there must be no whitespace between the leading dot  and  the
       two  characters  `s' and `o'.  Otherwise, only ggrrooffff interprets the ..ssoo
       request (and ssooeelliimm ignores it).

OOPPTTIIOONNSS
       --CC     Recognize ..ssoo even when followed by a character other than space
              or newline.

       --II_d_i_r  This  option  may  be used to add a directory to the search path
              for files (both those on the command line and those named in ..ssoo
              requests).   The  search  path  is  initialized with the current
              directory.  This option may be specified  more  than  once;  the
              directories are then searched in the order specified (but before
              the current directory).  If you want to make the current  direc-
              tory  be read before other directories, add --II.. at the appropri-
              ate place.

              No directory search is performed for files with an absolute file
              name.

       --rr     Do not add ..llff requests (for general use, with non-groff files).

       --tt     Don't  emit  ..llff  requests  but TeX comment lines (starting with
              `%') giving the current file and line number.

       --vv     Print the version number.

       The normal processing sequence of groff is this:

                 input        sourced
                 file          file
                   |             |
                   v             v
               preprocessor -> troff -> postprocessor
                                             |
                                             v
                                          output
                                           file

       That is, files sourced with ..ssoo are normally read _o_n_l_y  by  ttrrooffff  (the
       actual formatter).  ssooeelliimm is _n_o_t required for ttrrooffff to source files.

       If a file to be sourced should also be preprocessed, it must already be
       read _b_e_f_o_r_e the input file passes through the  preprocessor.   This  is
       handled by ssooeelliimm:

                 input
                 file
                   |
                   v
                 soelim -> preprocessor -> troff -> postprocessor
                   ^                                     |
                   |                                     v
                sourced                               output
                 file                                  file
