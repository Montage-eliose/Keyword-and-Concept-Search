NNAAMMEE
     ccoollccrrtt -- filter nroff output for CRT previewing

SSYYNNOOPPSSIISS
     ccoollccrrtt [--] [--22] [_f_i_l_e _._._.]

DDEESSCCRRIIPPTTIIOONN
     The ccoollccrrtt utility provides virtual half-line and reverse line feed
     sequences for terminals without such capability, and on which overstrik-
     ing is destructive.  Half-line characters and underlining (changed to
     dashing `-') are placed on new lines in between the normal output lines.

     The following options are available:

     --       Suppress all underlining.  This option is especially useful for
             previewing _a_l_l_b_o_x_e_d tables from tbl(1).

     --22      Cause all half-lines to be printed, effectively double spacing
             the output.  Normally, a minimal space output format is used
             which will suppress empty lines.  The program never suppresses
             two consecutive empty lines, however.  The --22 option is useful
             for sending output to the line printer when the output contains
             superscripts and subscripts which would otherwise be invisible.

EENNVVIIRROONNMMEENNTT
     The LANG, LC_ALL and LC_CTYPE environment variables affect the execution
     of ccoollccrrtt as described in environ(7).

EEXXIITT SSTTAATTUUSS
     The ccoollccrrtt utility exits 0 on success, and >0 if an error occurs.

EEXXAAMMPPLLEESS
     A typical use of ccoollccrrtt would be

     tbl exum2.n | nroff -ms | colcrt - | more

SSEEEE AALLSSOO
     col(1), more(1), nroff(1), troff(1), ul(1)

HHIISSTTOORRYY
     The ccoollccrrtt command appeared in 3.0BSD.

BBUUGGSS
     Should fold underlines onto blanks even with the '--' option so that a
     true underline character would show.

     Cannot back up more than 102 lines.

     General overstriking is lost; as a special case '|' overstruck with '-'
     or underline becomes '+'.

     Lines are trimmed to 132 characters.

     Some provision should be made for processing superscripts and subscripts
     in documents which are already double-spaced.

     Characters that take up more than one column position may not be under-
     lined correctly.
