       uuppttiimmee gives a one line display of the following information.  The cur-
       rent time, how long the system has been running,  how  many  users  are
       currently  logged  on,  and the system load averages for the past 1, 5,
       and 15 minutes.

       This is the same information contained in the header line displayed  by
       ww(1).

       System load averages is the average number of processes that are either
       in a runnable or uninterruptable state.  A process in a runnable  state
       is  either using the CPU or waiting to use the CPU.  A process in unin-
       terruptable state is waiting for some I/O access, eg waiting for  disk.
       The  averages  are  taken over the three time intervals.  Load averages
       are not normalized for the number of CPUs in a system, so a load  aver-
       age  of 1 means a single CPU system is loaded all the time while on a 4
       CPU system it means it was idle 75% of the time.
