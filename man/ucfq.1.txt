            Normally, the script presents the information in a human readable
            tabular format, but that may be harder for a machine to parse.
            With this option, the output is a compact, colon separated line,
            with no dividers, headers, or footer.

       ----ssttaattee--ddrr dir
            Set the state directory to "/path/to/dir" instead of the default
            "/var/lib/ucf".  Used mostly for testing.

       This script takes a set of arguments, each of which is a package name
       (and thus does not contain a /) or a full path to a configuration file,
       and outputs the associated package, if any, if the file exists on disk,
       and whether it has been modified by the user.  The output is either a
       human readable tabular form, or a compact colon-separated machine
       friendly format.

       This script can potentially be used in package "postrm" scripts during
       purge to query the system for configuration files that may still exist
       on the system, and whether these files have been locally modified by
       the user -- assuming that the package registered all the configuration
       files with uuccff using "ucfr".

       This is very inchoate, at the moment, and needs testing.
