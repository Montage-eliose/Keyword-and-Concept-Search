DDEESSCCRRIIPPTTIIOONN
       "pod2latex" is a program to convert POD format documentation (perlpod)
       into latex. It can process multiple input documents at a time and
       either generate a latex file per input document or a single combined
       output file.

OOPPTTIIOONNSS AANNDD AARRGGUUMMEENNTTSS
       This section describes the supported command line options. Minimum
       matching is supported.

       --oouutt
           Name of the output file to be used. If there are multiple input
           pods it is assumed that the intention is to write all translated
           output into a single file. ".tex" is appended if not present.  If
           the argument is not supplied, a single document will be created for
           each input file.

       --ffuullll
           Creates a complete "latex" file that can be processed immediately
           (unless "=for/=begin" directives are used that rely on extra
           packages).  Table of contents and index generation commands are
           included in the wrapper "latex" code.

       --sseeccttiioonnss
           Specify pod sections to include (or remove if negated) in the
           translation.  See "SECTION SPECIFICATIONS" in Pod::Select for the
           format to use for _s_e_c_t_i_o_n_-_s_p_e_c. This option may be given multiple
           times on the command line.This is identical to the similar option
           in the "podselect()" command.

       --mmooddiiffyy
           This option causes the output "latex" to be slightly modified from
           the input pod such that when a "=head1 NAME" is encountered a
           section is created containing the actual pod name (rather than
           NNAAMMEE) and all subsequent "=head1" directives are treated as
           subsections. This has the advantage that the description of a
           module will be in its own section which is helpful for including
           module descriptions in documentation.  Also forces "latex" label
           and index entries to be prefixed by the name of the module.

       --hh11lleevveell
           Specifies the "latex" section that is equivalent to a "H1" pod
           directive. This is an integer between 0 and 5 with 0 equivalent to
           a "latex" chapter, 1 equivalent to a "latex" section etc. The
           default is 1 ("H1" equivalent to a latex section).

       --hheellpp
           Print a brief help message and exit.

       --mmaann
           Print the manual page and exit.

       --vveerrbboossee
           Print information messages as each document is processed.

       --pprreeaammbbllee
           A user-supplied preamble for the LaTeX code. Multiple values are
           supported and appended in order separated by "\n".  See --pprreeffiillee
           for reading the preamble from a file.

       --ppoossttaammbbllee
           A user supplied postamble for the LaTeX code. Multiple values are
           supported and appended in order separated by "\n".  See --ppoossttffiillee
           for reading the postamble from a file.

       --pprreeffiillee
           A user-supplied preamble for the LaTeX code to be read from the
           named file. Multiple values are supported and appended in order.
           See --pprreeaammbbllee.

       --ppoossttffiillee
           A user-supplied postamble for the LaTeX code to be read from the
           named file. Multiple values are supported and appended in order.
           See --ppoossttaammbbllee.

BBUUGGSS
       Known bugs are:

       +o   Cross references between documents are not resolved when multiple
           pod documents are converted into a single output "latex" file.

       +o   Functions and variables are not automatically recognized and they
           will therefore not be marked up in any special way unless
           instructed by an explicit pod command.
