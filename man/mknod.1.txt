       Create the special file NAME of the given TYPE.

       Mandatory  arguments  to  long  options are mandatory for short options
       too.

       --mm, ----mmooddee=_M_O_D_E
              set file permission bits to MODE, not a=rw - umask

       --ZZ, ----ccoonntteexxtt=_C_T_X
              set the SELinux security context of NAME to CTX

       ----vveerrssiioonn
              output version information and exit

       Both MAJOR and MINOR must be specified when TYPE is b,  c,  or  u,  and
       they  must be omitted when TYPE is p.  If MAJOR or MINOR begins with 0x
       or 0X, it is interpreted as hexadecimal; otherwise, if it  begins  with
       0, as octal; otherwise, as decimal.  TYPE may be:

       b      create a block (buffered) special file

       c, u   create a character (unbuffered) special file

       p      create a FIFO

       NOTE:  your  shell  may  have  its  own version of mknod, which usually
       supersedes the version described here.  Please refer  to  your  shell's
       documentation for details about the options it supports.
