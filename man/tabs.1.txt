       ttaabbss - set tabs on a terminal

       ttaabbss [_o_p_t_i_o_n_s]] _[_t_a_b_s_t_o_p_-_l_i_s_t_]

       The  ttaabbss program clears and sets tab-stops on the terminal.  This uses
       the terminfo _c_l_e_a_r___a_l_l___t_a_b_s and _s_e_t___t_a_b  capabilities.   If  either  is
       absent,  ttaabbss is unable to clear/set tab-stops.  The terminal should be
       configured to use hard tabs, e.g.,

              stty tab0

       --TT_n_a_m_e
            Tell ttaabbss which terminal type to  use.   If  this  option  is  not
            given,  ttaabbss  will use the $$TTEERRMM environment variable.  If that is
            not set, it will use the _a_n_s_i_+_t_a_b_s entry.

       --dd   The debugging option shows a ruler  line,  followed  by  two  data
            lines.   The  first  data line shows the expected tab-stops marked
            with asterisks.  The second data line shows the actual  tab-stops,
            marked with asterisks.

       --nn   This  option tells ttaabbss to check the options and run any debugging
            option, but not to modify the terminal settings.

       --VV   reports the version of ncurses which was used in this program, and
            exits.

       The ttaabbss program processes a single list of tab stops.  The last option
       to be processed which defines a list is the  one  that  determines  the
       list to be processed.

   IImmpplliicciitt LLiissttss
       Use  a  single number as an option, e.g., "--55" to set tabs at the given
       interval (in this case 1, 6, 11, 16, 21, etc.).  Tabs are  repeated  up
       to the right margin of the screen.

       Use "--00" to clear all tabs.

       Use "--88" to set tabs to the standard interval.

   EExxpplliicciitt LLiissttss
       An  explicit list can be defined after the options (this does not use a
       "-").  The values in the list must be in increasing numeric order,  and
       greater than zero.  They are separated by a comma or a blank, for exam-
       ple,

              tabs 1,6,11,16,21
              tabs 1 6 11 16 21
       Use a '+' to treat a number as an increment relative  to  the  previous
       value, e.g.,

              tabs 1,+5,+5,+5,+5
       which is equivalent to the 1,6,11,16,21 example.

   PPrreeddeeffiinneedd TTaabb--SSttooppss
       X/Open defines several predefined lists of tab stops.

       --aa   Assembler, IBM S/370, first format

       --aa22  Assembler, IBM S/370, second format

       --cc   COBOL, normal format

       --cc22  COBOL compact format

       --cc33  COBOL compact format extended

       --ff   FORTRAN

       --pp   PL/I

       --ss   SNOBOL

       --uu   UNIVAC 1100 Assembler

PPOORRTTAABBIILLIITTYY
       X/Open  describes  a  ++mm option, to set a terminal's left-margin.  Very
       few of the entries in the terminal database provide this capability.

       The --dd (debug) and --nn (no-op) options are extensions  not  provided  by
       other implementations.

       Documentation for other implementations states that there is a limit on
       the number of tab stops.  While some terminals may not accept an  arbi-
       trary  number of tab stops, this implementation will attempt to set tab
       stops up to the right margin of the screen, if the given  list  happens
       to be that long.
