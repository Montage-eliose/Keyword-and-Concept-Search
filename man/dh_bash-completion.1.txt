       dh_bash-completion is a debhelper program that is responsible for
       installing completions for bash, usable installing the "bash-
       completion" package.

       If a file named debian/package.bash-completion exists, then different
       actions are performed, depending on its format.

       It can be a proper completion snippet, and in that case it would be
       installed in the completion directory, and no other actions would be
       performed.

       It can also be a list of files, with an optionally specified name to
       call the completion snippet after. The file format is as follows:

         my/path/to/foo-completion       # this would be installed as "foo-completion"
         my/path/to/bar-completion  baz  # this would be installed as "baz"
