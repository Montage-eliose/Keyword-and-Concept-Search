       _z_i_p_g_r_e_p will search files within a ZIP archive for lines  matching  the
       given  string  or  pattern.   _z_i_p_g_r_e_p  is  a  shell script and requires
       _e_g_r_e_p(1) and _u_n_z_i_p(1) to function.  Its output is identical to that  of
       _e_g_r_e_p(1).

AARRGGUUMMEENNTTSS
       _p_a_t_t_e_r_n
              The  pattern  to  be  located  within a ZIP archive.  Any
              string or regular expression accepted by _e_g_r_e_p(1) may  be
              used.   _f_i_l_e[_._z_i_p]  Path  of  the ZIP archive.  (Wildcard
              expressions for the ZIP archive name are not  supported.)
              If  the literal filename is not found, the suffix .zip is
              appended.  Note that self-extracting ZIP files  are  sup-
              ported,  as  with any other ZIP archive; just specify the
              .exe suffix (if any) explicitly.

       [_f_i_l_e_(_s_)]
              An optional list of archive members to be processed, sep-
              arated  by spaces.  If no member files are specified, all
              members of the ZIP archive are searched.  Regular expres-
              sions (wildcards) may be used to match multiple members:

              *      matches a sequence of 0 or more characters

              ?      matches exactly 1 character

              [...]  matches  any  single  character  found  inside the
                     brackets; ranges  are  specified  by  a  beginning
                     character,  a hyphen, and an ending character.  If
                     an exclamation point or a caret (`!' or `^')  fol-
                     lows  the  left bracket, then the range of charac-
                     ters within the brackets is complemented (that is,
                     anything _e_x_c_e_p_t the characters inside the brackets
                     is considered a match).

              (Be sure to quote any character that might  otherwise  be
              interpreted or modified by the operating system.)

       [--xx _x_f_i_l_e_(_s_)]
              An  optional  list of archive members to be excluded from
              processing.  Since wildcard  characters  match  directory
              separators  (`/'), this option may be used to exclude any
              files that are in subdirectories.  For example, ``zipgrep
              grumpy  foo  *.[ch]  -x */*'' would search for the string
              ``grumpy'' in all C source files in the main directory of
              the  ``foo''  archive,  but  none  in any subdirectories.
              Without the --xx option, all C source files in all directo-
              ries within the zipfile would be searched.

OOPPTTIIOONNSS
       All  options  prior  to  the  ZIP archive filename are passed to
       _e_g_r_e_p(1).
