NNAAMMEE
       ttooee - table of (terminfo) entries

SSYYNNOOPPSSIISS
       ttooee [--vv[_n]] [--aahhssuuUUVV] _f_i_l_e_._._.

DDEESSCCRRIIPPTTIIOONN
       With no options, ttooee lists all available terminal types by primary name
       with descriptions.   File  arguments  specify  the  directories  to  be
       scanned;  if  no such arguments are given, your default terminfo direc-
       tory is scanned.  If you also specify the --hh option, a directory header
       will be issued as each directory is entered.

       There are other options intended for use by terminfo file maintainers:

       --aa     report  on  all  of  the  terminal databases which ncurses would
              search, rather than only the first one that it finds.

              If the --ss is also given, ttooee adds a column to the report,  show-
              ing  (like  ccoonnfflliicctt(1))  which  entries which belong to a given
              terminal database.  An "*" marks entries which differ,  and  "+"
              marks equivalent entries.

       --ss     sort the output by the entry names.

       --uu _f_i_l_e
              says to write a report to the standard output, listing dependen-
              cies in the given terminfo/termcap source file.  The report con-
              denses  the  `use'  relation:  each line consists of the primary
              name of a terminal that has  use  capabilities,  followed  by  a
              colon, followed by the whitespace-separated primary names of all
              terminals which occur in those use capabilities, followed  by  a
              newline

       --UU _f_i_l_e
              says  to  write a report to the standard output, listing reverse
              dependencies in the given  terminfo/termcap  source  file.   The
              report  reverses  the  `use' relation: each line consists of the
              primary name of a terminal that occurs in use capabilities, fol-
              lowed  by  a colon, followed by the whitespace-separated primary
              names of all terminals which depend on it, followed  by  a  new-
              line.

       --vv_n    specifies  that  (verbose)  output be written to standard error,
              showing ttooee's progress.  The optional parameter _n  is  a  number
              from 1 to 10, interpreted as for ttiicc(1).

       --VV     reports  the  version of ncurses which was used in this program,
              and exits.
