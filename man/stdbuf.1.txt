NNAAMMEE
       stdbuf  - Run COMMAND, with modified buffering operations for its stan-
       dard streams.

DDEESSCCRRIIPPTTIIOONN
       Run COMMAND,  with  modified  buffering  operations  for  its  standard
       streams.

       Mandatory  arguments  to  long  options are mandatory for short options
       too.

       --ii, ----iinnppuutt=_M_O_D_E
              adjust standard input stream buffering

       --oo, ----oouuttppuutt=_M_O_D_E
              adjust standard output stream buffering

       --ee, ----eerrrroorr=_M_O_D_E
              adjust standard error stream buffering

       ----hheellpp display this help and exit

       ----vveerrssiioonn
              output version information and exit

       If MODE is 'L' the corresponding stream will be  line  buffered.   This
       option is invalid with standard input.

       If MODE is '0' the corresponding stream will be unbuffered.

       Otherwise  MODE is a number which may be followed by one of the follow-
       ing: KB 1000, K 1024, MB 1000*1000, M 1024*1024, and so on for G, T, P,
       E,  Z, Y.  In this case the corresponding stream will be fully buffered
       with the buffer size set to MODE bytes.

       NOTE: If COMMAND adjusts the buffering of its standard  streams  ('tee'
       does  for  e.g.) then that will override corresponding settings changed
       by 'stdbuf'.  Also some filters (like 'dd' and 'cat'  etc.)  don't  use
       streams for I/O, and are thus unaffected by 'stdbuf' settings.

       This will immedidately display unique entries from access.log

BBUUGGSS
       On GLIBC platforms, specifying a buffer size, i.e. using fully buffered
       mode will result in undefined operation.
