       ddeebb--ssyysstteemmdd--hheellppeerr is a Debian-specific helper script which re-
       implements the enable, disable, is-enabled and reenable commands from
       systemctl.

       The "enable" action will only be performed once (when first installing
       the package). On the first "enable", an state file is created which
       will be deleted upon "disable", but only when
       _DEB_SYSTEMD_HELPER_PURGE=1 to distinguish purge from remove.

       The "mask" action will keep state on whether the service was
       enabled/disabled before and will properly return to that state on
       "unmask".

       The "was-enabled" action is not present in systemctl, but is required
       in Debian so that we can figure out whether a service was enabled
       before we installed an updated service file. See
       http://bugs.debian.org/717603 for details.

       The "debian-installed" action is also not present in systemctl. It
       returns 0 if the state file of at least one of the given units is
       present.

       The "update-state" action is also not present in systemctl. It updates
       ddeebb--ssyysstteemmdd--hheellppeerr's state file, removing obsolete entries (e.g.
       service files that are no longer shipped by the package) and adding new
       entries (e.g.  new service files shipped by the package) without
       enabling them.

       ddeebb--ssyysstteemmdd--hheellppeerr is intended to be used from maintscripts to enable
       systemd unit files. It is specifically NOT intended to be used
       interactively by users. Instead, users should run systemd and use
       systemctl, or not bother about the systemd enabled state in case they
       are not running systemd.

           If you export _DEB_SYSTEMD_HELPER_DEBUG=1, deb-systemd-helper will
           print debug messages to stderr (thus visible in dpkg runs). Please
           include these when filing a bugreport.
