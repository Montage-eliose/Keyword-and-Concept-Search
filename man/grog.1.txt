       grog - guess options for groff command

       ggrroogg  reads  the input (file names or standard input) and guesses which
       of the ggrrooffff(1) options are needed to perform the input with the  ggrrooffff
       program.  The corresponding ggrrooffff command is output.

OOPPTTIIOONNSS
       The  only  ggrroogg  options recognized are --CC (which is also passed on) to
       enable compatibility mode; --vv and ----vveerrssiioonn print  information  on  the
       version  number; and --hh and ----hheellpp print usage information.  --vv, ----vveerr--
       ssiioonn, --hh, and ----hheellpp stop the program directly without printing a ggrrooffff
       command to standard output.

       All  other specified short options (words starting with one minus char-
       acter --) are interpreted as ggrrooffff options or option  clusters  with  or
       without  argument.  No space is allowed between options and their argu-
       ment.  Except from the --mm_a_r_g options, all options will  be  passed  on,
       i.e.  they are included unchanged in the command for the output without
       effecting the work of ggrroogg.

       A _f_i_l_e_s_p_e_c argument can either be the name of an  existing  file  or  a
       single  minus  --  to  mean standard input.  If no _f_i_l_e_s_p_e_c is specified
       standard input is read automatically.

DDEETTAAIILLSS
       ggrroogg reads all _f_i_l_e_s_p_e_c parameters as a whole.  It tries to guess which
       of the following ggrrooffff options are required for running the input under
       ggrrooffff: --ee, --mmaann, --mmee, --mmmm, --mmoomm, --mmss, --mmddoocc,, --mmddoocc--oolldd,, --pp, --RR, --gg, --GG,
       --ss,  and --tt.  The guessed ggrrooffff command including those options and the
       found _f_i_l_e_s_p_e_c parameters is put on the standard output.

       It is possible to specify arbitrary ggrrooffff options on the command  line.
       These  are  passed  on  the output without change, except for the --mm_a_r_g
       options.

       The ggrrooffff program has trouble when the wrong --mm_a_r_g option or several of
       these  options are specified.  In these cases, ggrroogg will print an error
       message and exit with an error code.  It is better to specify no  --mm_a_r_g
       option.   Because  such an option is only accepted and passed when ggrroogg
       does not find any of these options or the same option is found.

       If several different --mm_a_r_g options are found by ggrroogg an  error  message
       is  produced and the program is terminated with an error code.  But the
       output is written with the wrong options nevertheless.

       Remember that it is not necessary to determine a macro package.  A _r_o_f_f
       file  can also be written in the _g_r_o_f_f language without any macro pack-
       age.  ggrroogg will produce an output without an --mm_a_r_g option.

       As ggrrooffff also works with pure text files  without  any  _r_o_f_f  requests,
       ggrroogg cannot be used to identify a file to be a _r_o_f_f file.

       The ggrrooffffeerr(1) program heavily depends on a working ggrroogg.

       The  ggrroogg  source  contains  two files written in different programming
       languages: ggrroogg..ppll is the _P_e_r_l version, while ggrroogg..sshh is a shell script
       using  aawwkk(1).  During the run of mmaakkee(1), it is determined whether the
       system contains a suitable version  of  ppeerrll(1).   If  so,  ggrroogg..ppll  is
       transformed into ggrroogg; otherwise ggrroogg..sshh is used instead.

EEXXAAMMPPLLEESS
       +o      Calling

                     grog meintro.me

              results in

                     groff -me meintro.me

              So  ggrroogg recognized that the file _m_e_i_n_t_r_o_._m_e is written with the
              --mmee macro package.

       +o      On the other hand,

                     grog pic.ms

              outputs

                     groff -pte -ms pic.ms

              Besides determining the macro package --mmss, ggrroogg recognized  that
              the  file  _p_i_c_._m_s additionally needs --ppttee, the combination of --pp
              for _p_i_c, --tt for _t_b_l, and --ee for _e_q_n.

       +o      If both files are combined by the command

                     grog meintro.me pic.ms

              an error message is sent to standard error because ggrrooffff  cannot
              work with two different macro packages:

                     grog: error: there are several macro packages: -me -ms

              Additionally  the corresponding output with the wrong options is
              printed to standard output:

                     groff -pte -me -ms meintro.me pic.ms

              But the program is terminated with an error code.

       +o      The call of

                     grog -ksS -Tdvi grnexmpl.g

              contains several ggrrooffff options that are just passed on the  out-
              put without any interface to ggrroogg.  These are the option cluster
              --kkssSS consisting of --kk, --ss, and --SS; and the option --TT with  argu-
              ment ddvvii.  The output is

                     groff -ksS -Tdvi grnexmpl.g

              so  no  additional option was added by ggrroogg.  As no option --mm_a_r_g
              was found by ggrroogg this file does not use a macro package.
