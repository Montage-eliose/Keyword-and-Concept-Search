     The ccaalleennddaarr utility checks the current directory or the directory speci-
     fied by the CALENDAR_DIR environment variable for a file named _c_a_l_e_n_d_a_r
     and displays lines that begin with either today's date or tomorrow's.  On
     Fridays, events on Friday through Monday are displayed.

     The options are as follows:

     --AA _n_u_m  Print lines from today and next _n_u_m days (forward, future).
             Defaults to one. (same as -l)

     --aa      Process the ``calendar'' files of all users and mail the results
             to them.  This requires superuser privileges.

     --BB _n_u_m  Print lines from today and previous _n_u_m days (backward, past).

     --bb      Enforce special date calculation mode for KOI8 calendars.

     --ll _n_u_m  Print lines from today and next _n_u_m days (forward, future).
             Defaults to one. (same as -A)

     --ww _n_u_m  Print lines from today and next _n_u_m days, only if today is Friday
             (forward, future). Defaults to two, which causes ccaalleennddaarr to
             print entries through the weekend on Fridays.

     --ff _c_a_l_e_n_d_a_r_f_i_l_e
             Use _c_a_l_e_n_d_a_r_f_i_l_e as the default calendar file.

     --tt [[[_c_c]_y_y]_m_m]_d_d
             Act like the specified value is ``today'' instead of using the
             current date.  If yy is specified, but cc is not, a value for yy
             between 69 and 99 results in a cc value of 19.  Otherwise, a cc
             value of 20 is used.

     To handle calendars in your national code table you can specify
     ``LANG=<locale_name>'' in the calendar file as early as possible.  To
     handle national Easter names in the calendars, ``Easter=<national_name>''
     (for Catholic Easter) or ``Paskha=<national_name>'' (for Orthodox Easter)
     can be used.

     A special locale name exists: 'utf-8'.  Specifying ``LANG=utf-8'' indi-
     cates that the dates will be read using the C locale, and the descrip-
     tions will be encoded in UTF-8.  This is usually used for the distributed
     calendar files.  The ``CALENDAR'' variable can be used to specify the
     style.  Only 'Julian' and 'Gregorian' styles are currently supported.
     Use ``CALENDAR='' to return to the default (Gregorian).

     To enforce special date calculation mode for Cyrillic calendars you
     should specify ``LANG=<local_name>'' and ``BODUN=<bodun_prefix>'' where
     <local_name> can be ru_RU.KOI8-R, uk_UA.KOI8-U or by_BY.KOI8-B.

     Note that the locale is reset to the user's default for each new file
     that is read. This is so that locales from one file do not accidentally
     carry over into another file.

     Other lines should begin with a month and day.  They may be entered in
     almost any format, either numeric or as character strings.  If proper
     locale is set, national months and weekdays names can be used.  A single
     asterisk (`*') matches every month.  A day without a month matches that
     day of every week.  A month without a day matches the first of that
     month.  Two numbers default to the month followed by the day.  Lines with
     leading tabs default to the last entered date, allowing multiple line
     specifications for a single date.  ``Easter'' (may be followed by a posi-
     tive or negative integer) is Easter for this year.  ``Paskha'' (may be
     followed by a positive or negative integer) is Orthodox Easter for this
     year.  Weekdays may be followed by ``-4'' ... ``+5'' (aliases last,
     first, second, third, fourth) for moving events like ``the last Monday in
     April''.

     By convention, dates followed by an asterisk ('*') are not fixed, i.e.,
     change from year to year.

     Day descriptions start after the first <tab> character in the line; if
     the line does not contain a <tab> character, it isn't printed out.  If
     the first character in the line is a <tab> character, it is treated as
     the continuation of the previous description.

     The calendar file is preprocessed by cpp(1), allowing the inclusion of
     shared files such as company holidays or meetings.  If the shared file is
     not referenced by a full pathname, cpp(1) searches in the current (or
     home) directory first, and then in the directory directory _/_e_t_c_/_c_a_l_e_n_d_a_r,
     and finally in _/_u_s_r_/_s_h_a_r_e_/_c_a_l_e_n_d_a_r.  Empty lines and lines protected by
     the C commenting syntax (/* ... */) are ignored.

     Some possible calendar entries (a \\tt sequence denotes a <tab> character):

           LANG=C
           Easter=Ostern

           #include <calendar.usholiday>
           #include <calendar.birthday>

           6/15\\ttJune 15 (if ambiguous, will default to month/day).
           Jun. 15\\ttJune 15.
           15 June\\ttJune 15.
           Thursday\\ttEvery Thursday.

SSTTAANNDDAARRDDSS
     The ccaalleennddaarr program previously selected lines which had the correct date
     anywhere in the line.  This is no longer true: the date is only recog-
     nized when it occurs at the beginning of a line.

CCOOMMPPAATTIIBBIILLIITTYY
     The ccaalleennddaarr command will only display lines that use a <tab> character
     to separate the date and description, or that begin with a <tab>. This is
     different than in previous releases.

     The --tt flag argument syntax is from the original FreeBSD ccaalleennddaarr pro-
     gram.

     The --ll and --ww flags are Debian-specific enhancements. Also, the original
     ccaalleennddaarr program did not accept 0 as an argument to the --AA flag.

     Using 'utf-8' as a locale name is a Debian-specific enhancement.

     A ccaalleennddaarr command appeared in Version 7 AT&T UNIX.

BBUUGGSS
     ccaalleennddaarr doesn't handle all Jewish holidays or moon phases.
