       ddppkkgg--ssccaannssoouurrcceess scans the given _b_i_n_a_r_y_-_d_i_r for _._d_s_c files.  These  are
       used to create a Debian source index, which is output to stdout.

       The _o_v_e_r_r_i_d_e_-_f_i_l_e, if given, is used to set priorities in the resulting
       index records and to override the maintainer field given  in  the  _._d_s_c
       files.  The  file can be compressed. See ddeebb--oovveerrrriiddee(5) for the format
       of this file. Note: Since the override file is indexed by  binary,  not
       source packages, there's a bit of a problem here. The current implemen-
       tation uses the highest priority of all the binary packages produced by
       a  _._d_s_c  file  for the priority of the source package, and the override
       entry for the first binary package listed in the _._d_s_c  file  to  modify
       maintainer information. This might change.

       The  _p_a_t_h_-_p_r_e_f_i_x,  if given, is prepended to the directory field in the
       generated source index. You generally use this to  make  the  directory
       fields contain the path from the top of the Debian archive hierarchy.

       NNoottee::  If you want to access the generated Sources file with aapptt(8) you
       will probably need to compress the  file  with  ggzziipp(1)  (generating  a
       Sources.gz  file).  apt  ignores  uncompressed  Sources files except on
       local access (i.e.  ffiillee:://// sources).

       --nn, ----nnoo--ssoorrtt
           Don't sort the index records. Normally they are  sorted  by  source
           package name.


       --ee, ----eexxttrraa--oovveerrrriiddee _f_i_l_e
           Scan  _f_i_l_e  to find supplementary overrides (the file can be
           compressed). See ddeebb--eexxttrraa--oovveerrrriiddee(5) for more  information
           on its format.

       --ss, ----ssoouurrccee--oovveerrrriiddee _f_i_l_e
           Use  _f_i_l_e  as the source override file (the file can be com-
           pressed).  The default is the name of the override file  you
           specified with _._s_r_c appended.

           The  source  override file is in a different format from the
           binary override file. It contains only two whitespace  sepa-
           rated  fields,  the first is the source package name and the
           second is the section. Blank lines  and  comment  lines  are
           ignored  in  the normal manner. If a package appears in both
           files the source override takes precedence for  setting  the
           section.

       ----ddeebbuugg
           Turn debugging on.

       ----hheellpp
           Show the usage message and exit.

       ----vveerrssiioonn
           Show the version and exit.
