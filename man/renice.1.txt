     RReenniiccee alters the scheduling priority of one or more running processes.
     The following _w_h_o parameters are interpreted as process ID's, process
     group ID's, or user names.  RReenniiccee'ing a process group causes all pro-
     cesses in the process group to have their scheduling priority altered.
     RReenniiccee'ing a user causes all processes owned by the user to have their
     scheduling priority altered.  By default, the processes to be affected
     are specified by their process ID's.

     Options supported by rreenniiccee:

     --nn,, ----pprriioorriittyy
             The scheduling _p_r_i_o_r_i_t_y of the process, process group, or user.

     --gg,, ----ppggrrpp
             Force _w_h_o parameters to be interpreted as process group ID's.

     --uu,, ----uusseerr
             Force the _w_h_o parameters to be interpreted as user names.

     --pp,, ----ppiidd
             Resets the _w_h_o interpretation to be (the default) process ID's.

     --vv,, ----vveerrssiioonn
             Print version.

     --hh,, ----hheellpp
             Print help.

     For example,

     renice +1 987 -u daemon root -p 32

     would change the priority of process ID's 987 and 32, and all processes
     owned by users daemon and root.

     Users other than the super-user may only alter the priority of processes
     they own, and can only monotonically increase their ``nice value'' (for
     security reasons) within the range 0 to PRIO_MAX (20), unless a nice
     resource limit is set (Linux 2.6.12 and higher).  The super-user may
     alter the priority of any process and set the priority to any value in
     the range PRIO_MIN (-20) to PRIO_MAX.  Useful priorities are: 20 (the
     affected processes will run only when nothing else in the system wants
     to), 0 (the ``base'' scheduling priority), anything negative (to make
     things go very fast).

FFIILLEESS
     /etc/passwd  to map user names to user ID's

SSEEEE AALLSSOO
     getpriority(2), setpriority(2)

BBUUGGSS
     Non super-users can not increase scheduling priorities of their own pro-
     cesses, even if they were the ones that decreased the priorities in the
     first place.
     The Linux kernel (at least version 2.0.0) and linux libc (at least ver-
     sion 5.2.18) does not agree entirely on what the specifics of the system-
     call interface to set nice values is.  Thus causes renice to report bogus
     previous nice values.
