       The  _d_b_u_s_-_c_l_e_a_n_u_p_-_s_o_c_k_e_t_s  command  cleans  up  unused D-Bus connection
       sockets. See http://www.freedesktop.org/software/dbus/ for more  infor-
       mation about the big picture.


       If  given  no  arguments, _d_b_u_s_-_c_l_e_a_n_u_p_-_s_o_c_k_e_t_s cleans up sockets in the
       standard default socket directory for the  per-user-login-session  mes-
       sage  bus;  this is usually /tmp.  Optionally, you can pass a different
       directory on the command line.


       On Linux, this program is essentially useless, because  D-Bus  defaults
       to  using "abstract sockets" that exist only in memory and don't have a
       corresponding file in /tmp.


       On most other flavors of UNIX, it's possible for the  socket  files  to
       leak when programs using D-Bus exit abnormally or without closing their
       D-Bus   connections.   Thus,   it   might   be   interesting   to   run
       dbus-cleanup-sockets  in  a  cron job to mop up any leaked sockets.  Or
       you can just ignore the leaked sockets, they aren't really hurting any-
       thing, other than cluttering the output of "ls /tmp"


AAUUTTHHOORR
       dbus-cleanup-sockets    was    adapted   by   Havoc   Pennington   from
       linc-cleanup-sockets written by Michael Meeks.
