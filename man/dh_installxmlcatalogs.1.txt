       ddhh__iinnssttaallllxxmmllccaattaallooggss is a debhelper program that installs and
       registers XML catalog files.  It complies with the Debian XML/SGML
       policy.

       The file _d_e_b_i_a_n_/_p_a_c_k_a_g_e_._x_m_l_c_a_t_a_l_o_g_s lists the local XML catalog files
       to be installed per package as well as the XML entities in those local
       XML catalog files that are to be registered in the XML catalog system.

       The local XML catalog file entries in that file should be of the form
       "local;source;dest", where the verbatim "local" indicates this is an
       entry for a local XML catalog file, "source" indicates where the local
       XML catalog resides in the source tree, and "dest" indicates the
       destination location for the local XML catalog under the package build
       area.  "dest" should start with _/_u_s_r_/_s_h_a_r_e_/_x_m_l_/.

       The entries for the XML entities to be registered in the package XML
       catalog file should be of the form "package;type;id;catalog", where the
       verbatim "package" indicates this is an entry for an XML entity to be
       registered in the package XML catalog file, "type" indicates the XML
       entity type (public, system, uri), "id" indicates the XML entity id,
       and "catalog" indicates the local XML catalog file.

       The entries for the XML entities to be registered in the root XML
       catalog file should be of the form "root;type;id", where the verbatim
       "root" indicates this is an entry for an XML entity to be registered in
       the root XML catalog file, "type" indicates the XML entity type
       (public, system, uri), and "id" indicates the XML entity id.

       If an entry for is to be registered identically in the root catalog and
       the package catalog file, you can use the form
       "root-and-package;type;id;catalog", where the verbatim
       "root-and-package" indicates this is an entry for an XML entity to be
       registered in both the root and package XML catalog files, "type"
       indicates the XML entity type (public, system, uri), "id" indicates the
       XML entity id, and "catalog" indicates the local XML catalog file.

       XML entity types are described in _u_p_d_a_t_e_-_x_m_l_c_a_t_a_l_o_g(8).  Using the
       "root" or "package" commands, a type of "public" will general
       "delegatePublic" statements in the applicable catalog file. Generally
       you will want to use the types "public" for any formal public
       identifiers, and "system" for any files on the local filesystem or
       URLs.  "uri" is only used for non-local files which are not part of the
       external document subset, e.g., they are not used for entities or DTDs.

       ddhh__iinnssttaallllxxmmllccaattaallooggss automatically adds maintainer script snippets for
       the registration and unregistration of the listed XML entities in the
       XML catalog system (unless --nn is used).   A dependency on the xxmmll--ccoorree
       package will be added to "${misc:Depends}", so be sure to use that
       variable in the file _d_e_b_i_a_n_/_c_o_n_t_r_o_l.  See _d_h___i_n_s_t_a_l_l_d_e_b(1) for an
       explanation of Debhelper maintainer script snippets.

       Note that this command is not idempotent. "dh_clean -k" should be
       called between invocations of this command. Otherwise, it may cause
       multiple instances of the same text to be added to maintainer scripts.
