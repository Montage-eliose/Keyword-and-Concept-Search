       ddppkkgg--ddeebb packs, unpacks and provides information about Debian archives.

       Use ddppkkgg to install and remove packages from your system.

       You  can also invoke ddppkkgg--ddeebb by calling ddppkkgg with whatever options you
       want to pass to ddppkkgg--ddeebb. ddppkkgg will spot that you wanted  ddppkkgg--ddeebb  and
       run it for you.

       --bb, ----bbuuiilldd _d_i_r_e_c_t_o_r_y [_a_r_c_h_i_v_e|_d_i_r_e_c_t_o_r_y]
              Creates  a  debian  archive  from  the filesystem tree stored in
              _d_i_r_e_c_t_o_r_y. _d_i_r_e_c_t_o_r_y must have a DDEEBBIIAANN subdirectory, which con-
              tains  the  control  information  files such as the control file
              itself. This directory will _n_o_t appear in the  binary  package's
              filesystem  archive,  but instead the files in it will be put in
              the binary package's control information area.

              Unless you specify ----nnoocchheecckk, ddppkkgg--ddeebb will read  DDEEBBIIAANN//ccoonnttrrooll
              and parse it. It will check it for syntax errors and other prob-
              lems, and display the name of the binary  package  being  built.
              ddppkkgg--ddeebb  will  also  check  the  permissions  of the maintainer
              scripts and other files found in the DDEEBBIIAANN control  information
              directory.

              If  no _a_r_c_h_i_v_e is specified then ddppkkgg--ddeebb will write the package
              into the file _d_i_r_e_c_t_o_r_y..ddeebb.

              If the archive to be created already exists it will be overwrit-
              ten.

              If  the  second argument is a directory then ddppkkgg--ddeebb will write
              to the file _p_a_c_k_a_g_e___v_e_r_s_i_o_n___a_r_c_h..ddeebb, or _p_a_c_k_a_g_e___v_e_r_s_i_o_n..ddeebb  if
              no  AArrcchhiitteeccttuurree  field  is present in the package control file.
              When a target directory is specified, rather than  a  file,  the
              ----nnoocchheecckk  option  may not be used (since ddppkkgg--ddeebb needs to read
              and parse the package control file to determine  which  filename
              to use).

       --II, ----iinnffoo _a_r_c_h_i_v_e [_c_o_n_t_r_o_l_-_f_i_l_e_-_n_a_m_e...]
              Provides information about a binary package archive.

              If no _c_o_n_t_r_o_l_-_f_i_l_e_-_n_a_m_es are specified then it will print a sum-
              mary of the contents of the package as well as its control file.

              If any _c_o_n_t_r_o_l_-_f_i_l_e_-_n_a_m_es are specified then ddppkkgg--ddeebb will print
              them  in the order they were specified; if any of the components
              weren't present it will print an error message to  stderr  about
              each one and exit with status 2.

       --WW, ----sshhooww _a_r_c_h_i_v_e
              Provides  information about a binary package archive in the for-
              mat specified by the ----sshhoowwffoorrmmaatt argument. The  default  format
              displays  the  package's name and version on one line, separated
              by a tabulator.

       --ff, ----ffiieelldd _a_r_c_h_i_v_e [_c_o_n_t_r_o_l_-_f_i_e_l_d_-_n_a_m_e...]
              Extracts control file information from a binary package archive.

              If no ccoonnttrrooll--ffiillee--ffiieelldds are specified then it will  print  the
              whole control file.

              If any are specified then ddppkkgg--ddeebb will print their contents, in
              the order in which they appear in the control file. If more than
              one  ccoonnttrrooll--ffiillee--ffiieelldd  is specified then ddppkkgg--ddeebb will precede
              each with its field name (and a colon and space).

              No errors are reported for fields requested but not found.

       --cc, ----ccoonntteennttss _a_r_c_h_i_v_e
              Lists the contents of the filesystem tree archive portion of the
              package  archive.  It is currently produced in the format gener-
              ated by ttaarr's verbose listing.

       --xx, ----eexxttrraacctt _a_r_c_h_i_v_e _d_i_r_e_c_t_o_r_y
              Extracts the filesystem tree from a  package  archive  into  the
              specified directory.

              Note  that  extracting  a package to the root directory will _n_o_t
              result in a correct installation! Use ddppkkgg to install packages.

              _d_i_r_e_c_t_o_r_y (but not its parents) will be  created  if  necessary,
              and  its permissions modified to match the contents of the pack-
              age.

       --XX, ----vveexxttrraacctt _a_r_c_h_i_v_e _d_i_r_e_c_t_o_r_y
              Is like ----eexxttrraacctt (--xx) with ----vveerrbboossee (--vv) which prints a  list-
              ing of the files extracted as it goes.

       --RR, ----rraaww--eexxttrraacctt _a_r_c_h_i_v_e _d_i_r_e_c_t_o_r_y
              Extracts the filesystem tree from a package archive into a spec-
              ified directory, and the control information files into a DEBIAN
              subdirectory of the specified directory.

              The  target  directory  (but not its parents) will be created if
              necessary.

       ----ffssyyss--ttaarrffiillee _a_r_c_h_i_v_e
              Extracts the filesystem tree data  from  a  binary  package  and
              sends  it to standard output in ttaarr format. Together with ttaarr(1)
              this can be used to extract a particular file from a package ar-
              chive.  The input archive will always be processed sequentially.

       --ee, ----ccoonnttrrooll _a_r_c_h_i_v_e [_d_i_r_e_c_t_o_r_y]
              Extracts  the  control  information files from a package archive
              into the specified directory.

              If no directory is specified then a subdirectory DDEEBBIIAANN  in  the
              current directory is used.

              The  target  directory  (but not its parents) will be created if
              necessary.

       --??, ----hheellpp
              Show the usage message and exit.

       ----vveerrssiioonn
              Show the version and exit.

       ----sshhoowwffoorrmmaatt==_f_o_r_m_a_t
              This option is used to specify the format of the  output  ----sshhooww
              will  produce.  The  format  is a string that will be output for
              each package listed.

              The string may reference any status field  using  the  "${_f_i_e_l_d_-
              _n_a_m_e}"  form,  a list of the valid fields can be easily produced
              using --II on the same package. A complete explanation of the for-
              matting  options  (including escape sequences and field tabbing)
              can be found in the explanation of the  ----sshhoowwffoorrmmaatt  option  in
              ddppkkgg--qquueerryy(1).

              The default for this field is "${Package}\t${Version}\n".

       --zz_c_o_m_p_r_e_s_s_-_l_e_v_e_l
              Specify  which  compression level to use on the compressor back-
              end, when building a package (default is 9 for gzip and bzip2, 6
              for  xz  and  lzma).   The accepted values are 0-9 with: 0 being
              mapped to compressor none for gzip and 0 mapped to 1 for  bzip2.
              Before dpkg 1.16.2 level 0 was equivalent to compressor none for
              all compressors.

       --SS_c_o_m_p_r_e_s_s_-_s_t_r_a_t_e_g_y
              Specify which compression strategy  to  use  on  the  compressor
              backend,  when  building  a package (since dpkg 1.16.2). Allowed
              values are _n_o_n_e (since dpkg 1.16.4), _f_i_l_t_e_r_e_d, _h_u_f_f_m_a_n, _r_l_e  and
              _f_i_x_e_d for gzip (since dpkg 1.17.0) and _e_x_t_r_e_m_e for xz.

       --ZZ_c_o_m_p_r_e_s_s_-_t_y_p_e
              Specify  which  compression type to use when building a package.
              Allowed values are _g_z_i_p, _x_z, _b_z_i_p_2, _l_z_m_a, and _n_o_n_e  (default  is
              _x_z).

       ----ddeebb--ffoorrmmaatt==_f_o_r_m_a_t
              Set  the  archive  format version used when building (since dpkg
              1.17.0).  Allowed  values  are  _2_._0  for  the  new  format,  and
              _0_._9_3_9_0_0_0 for the old one (default is _2_._0).

              The old archive format is less easily parsed by non-Debian tools
              and is now obsolete; its only use is when building  packages  to
              be  parsed  by  versions  of  dpkg older than 0.93.76 (September
              1995), which was released as i386 a.out only.

       ----nneeww  This is a legacy alias for ----ddeebb--ffoorrmmaatt==22..00.

              making it behave like ----vveexxttrraacctt.

       Do not attempt to use just ddppkkgg--ddeebb to install software! You  must  use

       There is no authentication on ..ddeebb files; in fact, there isn't  even  a

       packages   nowadays   provide  an  md5sum  control  file  generated  by
