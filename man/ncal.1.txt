     The ccaall utility displays a simple calendar in traditional format and nnccaall
     offers an alternative layout, more options and the date of Easter.  The
     new format is a little cramped but it makes a year fit on a 25x80 termi-
     nal.  If arguments are not specified, the current month is displayed.

     The options are as follows:

     --hh      Turns off highlighting of today.

     --JJ      Display Julian Calendar, if combined with the --oo option, display
             date of Orthodox Easter according to the Julian Calendar.

     --ee      Display date of Easter (for western churches).

     --jj      Display Julian days (days one-based, numbered from January 1).

     --mm _m_o_n_t_h
             Display the specified _m_o_n_t_h.  If _m_o_n_t_h is specified as a decimal
             number, it may be followed by the letter 'f' or 'p' to indicate
             the following or preceding month of that number, respectively.

     --oo      Display date of Orthodox Easter (Greek and Russian Orthodox
             Churches).

     --pp      Print the country codes and switching days from Julian to Grego-
             rian Calendar as they are assumed by nnccaall.  The country code as
             determined from the local environment is marked with an asterisk.

     --ss _c_o_u_n_t_r_y___c_o_d_e
             Assume the switch from Julian to Gregorian Calendar at the date
             associated with the _c_o_u_n_t_r_y___c_o_d_e.  If not specified, nnccaall tries
             to guess the switch date from the local environment or falls back
             to September 2, 1752.  This was when Great Britain and her
             colonies switched to the Gregorian Calendar.

     --ww      Print the number of the week below each week column.

     --yy      Display a calendar for the specified year. This option is implied
             when a year but no month are specified on the command line.

     --33      Display the previous, current and next month surrounding today.

     --11      Display only the current month. This is the default.

     --AA _n_u_m_b_e_r
             Months to add after. The specified number of months is added to
             the end of the display. This is in addition to any date range
             selected by the --yy, --33, or --11 options. For example, ``cal -y -B2
             -A2'' shows everything from November of the previous year to Feb-
             ruary of the following year. Negative numbers are allowed, in
             which case the specified number of months is subtracted. For
             example, ``cal -y -B-6'' shows July to December. And ``cal -A11''
             simply shows the next 12 months.

     --BB _n_u_m_b_e_r
             Months to add before. The specified number of months is added to
             the beginning of the display. See --AA for examples.

     --CC      Switch to ccaall mode.

     --NN      Switch to nnccaall mode.

     --dd _y_y_y_y_-_m_m
             Use _y_y_y_y_-_m_m as the current date (for debugging of date selec-
             tion).

     --HH _y_y_y_y_-_m_m_-_d_d
             Use _y_y_y_y_-_m_m_-_d_d as the current date (for debugging of highlight-
             ing).

     --MM      Weeks start on Monday.

     --SS      Weeks start on Sunday.

     --bb      Use oldstyle format for ncal output.

     A single parameter specifies the year (1-9999) to be displayed; note the
     year must be fully specified: ``cal 89'' will _n_o_t display a calendar for
     1989.  Two parameters denote the month and year; the month is either a
     number between 1 and 12, or a full or abbreviated name as specified by
     the current locale.  Month and year default to those of the current sys-
     tem clock and time zone (so ``cal -m 8'' will display a calendar for the
     month of August in the current year).

     Not all options can be used together. For example, the options --yy, --33,
     and --11 are mutually exclusive. If inconsistent options are given, the
     later ones take precedence over the earlier ones.

     A year starts on January 1.

HHIISSTTOORRYY
     A ccaall command appeared in Version 5 AT&T UNIX.  The nnccaall command appeared
     in FreeBSD 2.2.6.  The output of the ccaall command is supposed to be bit
     for bit compatible to the original Unix ccaall command, because its output
     is processed by other programs like CGI scripts, that should not be bro-
     ken. Therefore it will always output 8 lines, even if only 7 contain
     data. This extra blank line also appears with the original ccaall command,
     at least on Solaris 8

AAUUTTHHOORRSS
     The nnccaall command and manual were written by Wolfgang Helbig
     <helbig@FreeBSD.org>.

BBUUGGSS
     The assignment of Julian-Gregorian switching dates to country codes is
     historically naive for many countries.

     Not all options are compatible and using them in different orders will
     give varying results.
