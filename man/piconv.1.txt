DDEESSCCRRIIPPTTIIOONN
       ppiiccoonnvv is perl version of iiccoonnvv, a character encoding converter widely
       available for various Unixen today.  This script was primarily a
       technology demonstrator for Perl 5.8.0, but you can use piconv in the
       place of iconv for virtually any case.

       piconv converts the character encoding of either STDIN or files
       specified in the argument and prints out to STDOUT.

       Here is the list of options.  Each option can be in short format (-f)
       or long (--from).

       -f,--from from_encoding
           Specifies the encoding you are converting from.  Unlike iiccoonnvv, this
           option can be omitted.  In such cases, the current locale is used.

       -t,--to to_encoding
           Specifies the encoding you are converting to.  Unlike iiccoonnvv, this
           option can be omitted.  In such cases, the current locale is used.

           Therefore, when both -f and -t are omitted, ppiiccoonnvv just acts like
           ccaatt.

       -s,--string _s_t_r_i_n_g
           uses _s_t_r_i_n_g instead of file for the source of text.

       -l,--list
           Lists all available encodings, one per line, in case-insensitive
           order.  Note that only the canonical names are listed; many aliases
           exist.  For example, the names are case-insensitive, and many
           standard and common aliases work, such as "latin1" for
           "ISO-8859-1", or "ibm850" instead of "cp850", or "winlatin1" for
           "cp1252".  See Encode::Supported for a full discussion.

       -C,--check _N
           Check the validity of the stream if _N = 1.  When _N = -1, something
           interesting happens when it encounters an invalid character.

       -c  Same as "-C 1".

       -p,--perlqq
       --htmlcref
       --xmlcref
           Applies PERLQQ, HTMLCREF, XMLCREF, respectively.  Try

             piconv -f utf8 -t ascii --perlqq

           To see what it does.

       -h,--help
           Show usage.

       -D,--debug
           Invokes debugging mode.  Primarily for Encode hackers.

       -S,--scheme scheme
           Selects which scheme is to be used for conversion.  Available
           schemes are as follows:

           from_to
               Uses Encode::from_to for conversion.  This is the default.

           decode_encode
               Input strings are _d_e_c_o_d_e_(_)d then _e_n_c_o_d_e_(_)d.  A straight two-
               step implementation.

           perlio
               The new perlIO layer is used.  NI-S' favorite.

               You should use this option if you are using UTF-16 and others
               which linefeed is not $/.

           Like the _-_D option, this is also for Encode hackers.
